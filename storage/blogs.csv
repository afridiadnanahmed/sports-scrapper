If your home is not prepared for the coming winter season||||| you could end up paying the price for it.</p><p>Here are some tips to help save you cash and spare you the trouble of having to deal with plumbing issues during as the weather cools down:</p><p><strong>1.</strong><strong>Protect your pipes from freezing:</strong> When the temperature drops||||| water can freeze within your pipes||||| causing them to burst. If you are away or simply unaware of the burst pipe||||| the results of this can be devastating||||| leading to massive floods and damage to your furniture||||| rugs||||| and the home&rsquo;s structure. To reduce the chances of frozen pipes. Wrap your un-insulated pipes in a blanket of foam||||| which can be purchased at any hardware store. To secure it||||| use duct tape. In some cases||||| the foam might have self-adhesive edges.</p><p><strong>2.</strong><strong>Fix plumbing leaks:</strong> Do not put off getting home plumbing leaks fixed. Check the faucets in your kitchen||||| bathrooms||||| and utility rooms for any drips or puddles. If any of your faucets are leaking||||| contact a plumber immediately to get your pipes back in shape.</p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong>Drain your water heater: </strong>Does your area have hard water? If so||||| sediment can build up in your tank||||| which causes rust to develop. The rust can then find its way into your drinking||||| cooking||||| and bathing water. If you have a water heater that is already rusted or is too old||||| purchase a new one before the weather gets cold.</p><p><strong>4.</strong><strong>Disconnect your garden house:</strong> If you leave your outdoor hose connected during the winter season||||| the water left inside might freeze and expand||||| affecting your faucets and other connecting pipes. The wisest thing to do is disconnect||||| wrap up||||| and put away your garden hose until the warm weather returns. The last thing you want to do is face hefty repair bills for something so avoidable.</p><p><strong>5.</strong><strong>Close and drain shut-off valves that lead outdoors: </strong>Do you have interior shut off valves that lead to outdoor faucets? Close them and drain the water out from outside lines. If any water remains in the lines||||| it could freeze and cause some major damage that will end up costing you.</p><p><strong>6.</strong><strong>Clean your home&rsquo;s sump pump pit:</strong> Before the winter weather sets in||||| take the time to inspect and clean your sump pump and its pit. The pump can freeze when exposed to extremely cold weather||||| causing it to stop working. If your sump pump malfunctions||||| this can cause some serious trouble. Water can enter your basement and cause flooding||||| particularly when the winter rains start pouring. To prevent flood damage and serious clean-up bills||||| inspect your pump and pit now.</p><p>The winter time is for family and holiday gatherings. Make sure your season is full of cheer instead of exploding pipes and leaks||||| and start preparing and repairing your plumbing now. You will thank yourself later.</p><h2>Plumbing||||| Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Services and Repair</h2><p>For the past 40 years||||| Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling has been providing customers with superior service at affordable prices throughout Indiana and Ohio.

If it is not properly functioning||||| however||||| you could be in for a rough season that not only includes discomfort||||| but high energy bills as well. To ensure your home heating bill remains reasonable||||| and your hard-earned money does not go to waste||||| you will need to support your HVAC system by following some of these simple tips:</p><p><strong>1.</strong><strong>Change the air filter and remember to clean the vents:</strong> Incidentally||||| one of the most important things you can do to support your HVAC system is also one of the easiest things you can do. Change your air filter at least once every three months||||| and make sure you check it once a month. If it is dirty||||| replace it. Regardless if it is dirty or not||||| you must change it every three months. After you replace your filter||||| vacuum off the air vents||||| keeping them clean to allow warm air to flow easily. This will improve temperature regulation throughout the home.</p><p><strong>2.</strong><strong>Have your HVAC system inspected:</strong> Scheduling a yearly service for your HVAC system will help ensure that it is functioning properly. The best time to have it inspected is in the fall to prepare it for the winter ahead. Having these regular maintenance appointments will help identify any potential problem areas that might otherwise be unseen||||| leading to costly repairs in the future.</p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong>Replace your ancient HVAC system:</strong> True||||| replacing the HVAC system in your home can be expensive||||| but the costs well outweigh the discomfort and costs of keeping an old and inefficient system. If your HVAC system is more than 10 years old||||| do yourself a favor and consult with a service technician to get a professional opinion regarding the longevity of your system. Replacing it can reduce your energy bill||||| saving you money in the long run.</p><p><strong>4.</strong><strong>Make sure your attic is adequately insulated:</strong> Help your HVAC system operate at peak performance by lightening its load. If you insulate your home&rsquo;s attic||||| you can keep warm air in your home||||| preventing it from escaping outside. What does this mean for your HVAC system? It will not have to work as hard to maintain the home&rsquo;s proper temperature. How do you know if your home&rsquo;s attic is sufficiently insulated? According to EnergyStar.gov||||| insulation in the attic should be high enough to obstruct the view of floor joists.</p><p><strong>5.</strong><strong>Consider installing a programmable thermostat:</strong> The temperature of your home should be based on who is there and||||| if no one is home||||| can be set significantly lower than a conventional living area temperature. Unfortunately||||| too many homeowners neglect to adjust their thermostats when they leave their home because they forget||||| think it is too much work||||| or simply do not want to return to a cold home. To eliminate these issues||||| install a programmable thermostat||||| which will allow you to set the temperature in your home for every hour of the day. It will keep to the schedule you set day after day||||| until you decide to alter it according to your needs. Depending on the device you choose||||| you might even be able to adjust the temperature from your smartphone||||| allowing you to alter the settings of your thermostat whenever and wherever you are.</p><p>If you want to stay cozy this winter||||| prepare your HVAC system for the upcoming weather. It will be worth the investment.</p><h2>Request Your Service Today!</h2><p>At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we have been providing the highest quality plumbing||||| heating||||| and air conditioning services since 1969.

It is possible that you are making some major mistakes with your home&rsquo;s air conditioning system||||| undercutting its effectiveness and efficiency. In fact||||| poorly maintained systems can even become contaminated with microorganisms that can be detrimental to your health if inhaled.</p><p><strong>Here are some of the most common mistakes people make with their home&rsquo;s air conditioning:</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong><strong>You do not change or clean your filters:</strong> You should change the filter on your central AC unit at least once every three months||||| or as often as once a month||||| depending on how frequently your system is running. Why is this important? If you neglect to change or clean your filters||||| this can cause poor air flow or freeze up the unit&rsquo;s evaporator coil. Additionally||||| your dirty filter might add between 5% and 15% to your AC bill and shorten the lifespan of your system. Save yourself some money by replacing the filters||||| which are usually less than $10. If you have ductless split AC units||||| you can simply wipe of the filter with a rag.</p><p><strong>2.</strong><strong>You do not service your system annually:</strong> There are certain necessary maintenance operations that must be performed once a year to keep your system up and running efficiently. Call in a professional to do this and it will save you money in the long run.</p><p><strong>3.</strong><strong>You set your thermostat too low:</strong> Your body is capable of much more than you think. It can adapt to hot or cold temperatures rather quickly||||| often within a week or two. Considering that you can cut up to 3% off your AC bill for every degree you raise the temperature||||| you might want to sweat through the period of adjustment and try setting your thermostat in the high 70s to reduce your bill.</p><p><strong>4.</strong><strong>You neglect your fans:</strong> Fans are an effective way to stay cool during the summer months and remove some of the burden from your overworked AC system. If you are using ceiling fans||||| make sure they turn counterclockwise||||| which promotes better air flow.</p><p><strong>5.</strong><strong>Your thermostat or vents are poorly positioned:</strong> Your thermostat might get thrown off if it is getting blasted by the sun or a lamp||||| causing it to crank the AC unnecessarily even when your place is already cool. If you are away during the day||||| you might not even be aware that your system is working overtime.</p><p><strong>6.</strong><strong>You are keeping empty rooms cool:</strong> Are your AC vents open in every room of your house? If they are||||| you are keeping a lot of unused square footage cool on a day-to-day basis. Walk around your home and close the vents that open onto unoccupied rooms and close closet doors to ensure those areas are not eating up your cold air.</p><p><strong>7.</strong><strong>You do not have any blinds or curtains:</strong> The sun is your AC system&rsquo;s worst enemy. If you keep your blinds closed or slide your curtains to block the sun||||| you can protect your space from the sun&rsquo;s heat||||| which also means your AC system will run less frequently||||| saving you money.</p><h2>Hire An Insured Service Professional Today</h2><p>Since our inception in 1969||||| Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling has been providing the highest quality plumbing||||| heating||||| and air conditioning services at prices you can afford.

With  	 temperatures spiking across the country||||| many people will be relying on  	 their units to work well. Learn what you can do to avoid overtaxing your  	 HVAC system so your home can stay cool.  </p>  <p>A strained air conditioning system can break down||||| costing you in expensive  	 repairs. When it breaks down in the middle of a heatwave||||| you may worry  	 you&rsquo;ll melt in the heat before your HVAC repair service can take  	 care of it. Maintenance is an important part of keeping your cooling system  	 up and running. Check that your system is free of debris or blockages|||||  	 and check your refrigerant levels. Your HVAC system should receive an  	 annual tune up to get it ready for summer weather. Regular filter changes  	 can reduce strain on your system and keep it from working as hard to move  	 air through your home. Check your filters and change them out when they  	 begin to clog with dust. Schedule routine maintenance for your system  	 to prevent costly repairs later.</p>  <p>Maintaining a constant temperature is also important for your system. Lowering  	 the thermostat too much won&rsquo;t result in your house cooling off any  	 faster||||| just a strained system as your HVAC unit tries to keep up with  	 your demands. Set your thermostat to a comfortable temperature and leave  	 it there. Your system will reach that temperature more quickly||||| and won&rsquo;t  	 have to work as hard to do so. You may also want to raise your thermostat  	 by a few degrees. While it seems counterintuitive||||| you may find you have  	 a range of comfortable temperatures||||| and even a few degrees can take the  	 pressure off of your cooling system.</p>  <p>Prevent other sources of heat in your home. Reduce solar warming by closing  	 windows and blinds||||| especially on the south and west sides of your home.  	 Invest in solar or thermal curtain for extra temperature control. Don&rsquo;t  	 forget to cover glass doors as well||||| as they can let heat and light in  	 that can raise the temperature inside your home. Seal air leaks around  	 your windows and doors||||| and keep them closed. Keep your home insulated|||||  	 and ensure that there is adequate ventilation in your attic to prevent  	 warm air from moving through your home.</p>  <p>Avoid using appliances such as dryers||||| washing machines||||| dishwashers||||| ovens|||||  	 and other heat-producing appliances. Turn off lights that you aren&rsquo;t  	 using||||| and turn on fans to help move cooled air through your home. Fans  	 work best when you&rsquo;re in the room to enjoy the breeze||||| so save power  	 and turn them off when you leave. Consider installing attic fans or whole  	 house fans to draw heat out of your home during peak temperatures.</p>  <p>Landscaping can play a big role in helping your home stay cool. If you  	 live in warm climates||||| you may want to consider investing in shade trees  	 or trellises to block the sun. Awnings||||| patio covers||||| and reflective window  	 tinting can also be employed to protect your windows from solar warming|||||  	 and make it easier on your system to cool your home.</p>  <p>  	<em>Get your system ready for high summer temperatures.

Many homes need only small changes to increase their  	 eco-friendliness by decreasing their power and water use. Learn some ways  	 you can make your home more eco-friendly.</p>  <h3>Install Programmable Thermostats</h3>  <p>A programmable thermostat can regulate your home&rsquo;s temperature according  	 to your schedule||||| so that your system is using less energy when you are  	 out of the house. Set your system to turn off or change temperature when  	 you aren&rsquo;t home||||| and to bring the temperature to a more comfortable  	 setting when you are home. These thermostats can save you money all year|||||  	 and ensure that your home is always comfortable when you want it to be.</p>  <h3>Fix and Prevent Air Leaks</h3>  <p>  	Fix caulking and weather-stripping around your doors and windows to keep  	 air from leaking in or out. Hot air can be drawn into a cool house from  	 outside||||| or you can lose warm air to the chilly outdoors during winter.  	 Sealing these leaks can save you on energy costs and make your home easier to  	<a href=""/services/heating/"">heat</a> and  	<a href=""/services/cooling/"">cool</a>.  </p>  <h3>Choose Energy Efficient Appliances</h3>  <p>Energy Star rated appliances use less energy to run||||| and can significantly  	 reduce your electricity and water usage. Switching out your appliances  	 for energy-efficient ones can save you significantly on utility bills.  	 Energy-efficient appliances include dishwashers||||| washing machines||||| water  	 heaters||||| and more.</p>  <h3>Reduce Your Water Use</h3>  <p>Leaky faucets||||| inefficient appliances||||| and landscaping can all raise your  	 water bill. Replace outdated faucets and showerheads with low-flow options  	 or install aerators to reduce your water usage. Toilets can be swapped  	 out for low-flow options as well. Consider installing a recirculating  	 pump to deliver hot water instantly and prevent you from waiting for the  	 tap water to warm up.</p>  <p>Look at your yard&rsquo;s water usage as well. Lawns can take a considerable  	 amount of water||||| whereas native plants often use less. You may want to  	 update your yard with low-water options or reduce the amount of lawn you  	 have with a patio or other ground covering. If you do want to keep your  	 lawn||||| check that you aren&rsquo;t over watering and consider updating  	 your sprinkler system for a more efficient system.</p>  <h3>Use Fans to Save Energy</h3>  <p>Ceiling fans can be used year-round to maintain a comfortable environment  	 in your home. During the summer||||| they can create a breeze to help you  	 feel cool. In the winter||||| the direction your fan rotates can be reversed  	 so the fan pushes warm air down||||| allowing you to spend less to heat your  	 home. Air movement is important for helping spread heated or cooled air  	 through your whole home.</p>  <h3>Use Thermal Drapes</h3>  <p>Thermal drapes can help you balance the temperature in your home. Close  	 them during the day over summer to block out solar heat||||| and close them  	 overnight in winter to keep warm air inside. Drapes can be an inexpensive  	 solution to drafty windows||||| as well be an attractive addition to your  	 living space.</p>  <h3>Install a Whole House Fan</h3>  <p>A whole house fan can often replace your air conditioning needs. A fan  	 installed in your homes attic draws hot air out of your home and pushes  	 it through the vents in your attic. When running a whole house fan||||| you  	 must open your windows to allow air to be pulled inside by the fan. These  	 fans create air movement through your entire house and are a more energy  	 efficient alternative to a traditional HVAC system.</p>  <p>  	<em>Do you need help increasing your home&rsquo;s eco-friendliness?

The main valve may  		 require a key||||| or your main line may be available on the lowest floor  		 of your home||||| such as your laundry room||||| utility room||||| or basement.</li>  	<li>Turn off outside faucets and disconnect any hoses &ndash; Drips and leaks  		 can increase your water bills drastically. Turning off outside faucets  		 may also save you from someone else stealing your water.</li>  	<li>Turn off and drain your water heater &ndash; This can help prevent flooding  		 in your home||||| and will save you money as well. Once you drain the water  		 and let it cool||||| you can recycle it to water any plants or gardens||||| wash  		 your car||||| etc.</li>  	<li>Set a timer for your sprinkler system</li>  	<li>Empty standing water from toilets and sink traps &ndash; This can prevent  		 leaks||||| foul odors||||| mold||||| and mildew.</li>  </ul>  <p>Don&rsquo;t let your summer vacation be ruined by coming home to a big|||||  	 costly mess. If you have had the misfortune of coming home to a plumbing  	 emergency||||| the expert technicians at Summers&trade; Plumbing Heating &amp;  	 Cooling have the experience to help you quickly and efficiently.

Your HVAC professional can prepare your system to be switched on again with a thorough cleaning. Cleaning your system early before you turn it on will have the greatest affect on your allergies. If you run your HVAC system before it has been cleaned||||| you will spread the allergens through your home. The HVAC technician should also check your ducts for mold growth.</p><p>Be sure to regularly check your filters||||| and replace or clean them when needed.

Inspecting your air conditioning system before  	 the summer weather comes can help uncover any problems before you&rsquo;re  	 dealing with the heat and your repair service is busy. In your inspection|||||  	 be sure to:  </p>  <ul>  	<li>Uncover your condenser unit||||| and wash off any dust</li>  	<li>Clean or replace filters</li>  	<li>Test if your air conditioner cools your home</li>  	<li>Check your thermostat settings and ensure they still meet your needs</li>  </ul>  <p>If there is a problem with your system||||| it is time to call a repair service.  	 They can test your system and air ducts for leaks and blockages.</p>  <h3>Check Your Home&rsquo;s Insulation</h3>  <p>The insulation in your attic can compact over time||||| meaning it may leave  	 gaps where warm air can filter in to your home. Check the insulation in  	 your attic for openings||||| and fill these as needed. If you need to fix  	 a large amount of insulation||||| you may wish to call a professional to re-insulate  	 your house||||| as it can get messy. While you&rsquo;re in the attic||||| inspect  	 vents and ducts as well. If you find they are leaking||||| you can seal them  	 with expanding foam. Make sure your vents aren&rsquo;t blocked||||| so they  	 can let hot air out of your attic and prevent it from warming your house.</p>  <h3>Protect Your Windows and Doors</h3>  <p>Examine your windows and exterior doors for leaks where cool air may be  	 escaping. You can seal these with caulk and weather-stripping. Windows  	 that have lots of exposure to the sun can also warm your home. You may  	 consider investing in awnings to shade these windows||||| or installing blinds|||||  	 light blocking curtains||||| or reflective film.</p>  <h3>Reverse Your Ceiling Fans</h3>  <p>Ceiling fans keep air moving around your home||||| but the way they function  	 should change with the season. When you are heating your home||||| a ceiling  	 fan should be set to rotate clockwise||||| which allows it to distribute the  	 warm air that rises to the ceiling. During the summer months||||| however|||||  	 it should be set to spin counter-clockwise||||| which will create a pleasant  	 breeze. Your fan can be changed by flipping the small switch located near the base.</p>  <p>  	<em>Prepare for summer and keep your wallet happy with  		<a href=""/"">Summers&trade; Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling</a>.

Because this doesn&rsquo;t happen often||||| homeowners are  	 often surprised when they learn that what they believed to be common knowledge  	 when it comes to garbage disposals is actually a completely untrue myth.  	 Here are four common myths that many people don&rsquo;t realize are completely false.</p>  <h3>Garbage Disposals Don&rsquo;t Have Blades</h3>  <p>The loud noises coming from your garbage disposal is not a series of sharp  	 blades hacking food into tiny bits. In reality||||| garbage disposals use  	 shredding teeth||||| which are either plastic or metal circles that contain  	 a row of sharp metal rectangles. Food and other material is thrown into  	 them when the teeth spin and is quickly decimated into small||||| easily disposed bits.</p>  <h3>You Can&rsquo;t Sharpen Your Blades</h3>  <p>Again||||| garbage disposals don&rsquo;t have blades||||| so logically you can&rsquo;t  	 sharpen them. This means the common practices of throwing ice into the  	 disposal is more or less useless and ineffective. What you can do to improve  	 your disposal&rsquo;s condition||||| however||||| is clean it. Use baking soda|||||  	 vinegar||||| rock salt||||| and lemon will help eliminate odors and loosen any  	 food or grime that has built up in your unit.</p>  <h3>You Can Throw Nearly Anything in There</h3>  <p>  	Many people become complacent with just scraping leftover meal scraps down  	 the drain rather than take them to the trash can||||| especially when dishes  	 are already in the sink. However||||| your garbage disposal may not be robust  	 enough to handle the pieces you are feeding into it. A good rule to follow:  	<strong>if you can&rsquo;t chew it||||| neither can your unit. </strong>Think twice before putting things like eggshells||||| small bones||||| and other  	 solid scraps down there: you&rsquo;re probably ruining your system entirely.  </p>  <h3>Running Hot Water Prevents Clogs</h3>  <p>People often think there&rsquo;s no problem with putting grease or oil  	 down your garbage disposal so long as you run hot water with it to keep  	 it melted. In reality||||| water and oil don&rsquo;t mix so the oil is probably  	 sticking pretty heavily to your shredding teeth||||| leaving a nasty film  	 that can clog and seize them. Oil can also lead to clogs and blockages  	 in your plumbing||||| so the best practice is to let oil reach room temperature  	 and empty it into the trash.</p>  <p>  	<em>If your garbage disposal is having trouble or stops working||||| call  		<strong>Summers&trade; Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling</strong> for help. Since 1969||||| our fully-trained and licensed Indiana plumbers  		 have provided high-quality repairs and services for all your sink and  		 garbage disposal issues.

Replacing  	 your system can be an immense cost||||| and many homeowners want to avoid  	 this financial burden as much as possible. One of the best ways is to  	 simply prolong the life of your system and make it last for as many years  	 as possible before replacing it. How can you do this? Give your system  	 a little extra attention and care and you should notice a significant  	 increase in its lifespan. Here are five tips for extending the life of  	 your air conditioner.</p>  <h3>Replace Your Filter</h3>  <p>Your air conditioner has an air filter that prevents dust||||| dirt||||| and allergens  	 from entering your home. As with any other type of air filter||||| over time  	 it fills up with pollutants and doesn&rsquo;t work as well. A dirty filter  	 can reduce the effectiveness of your system||||| forcing it to run longer  	 and more frequently||||| which dramatically reduces its lifespan. Be sure  	 to check and replace your filter every year.</p>  <h3>Clean Your Coils</h3>  <p>Over the months and years of service||||| your evaporator and condenser coils  	 will collect dirt and dust||||| which insulate the coil and reduce its effectiveness.  	 A dirty coil has dramatically reduced airflow and has its ability to absorb  	 heat reduced substantially. Cleaning your coil annually (especially if  	 it is located near dirt or foliage) can help it last much longer and run  	 more efficiently.</p>  <h3>Straighten Your Coil Fins</h3>  <p>Bent fins on your condenser and evaporator coils reduce their ability to  	 transfer heat and cool your home. Not only do bent fins trap heat and  	 make your coils less efficient||||| but they also can block airflow which  	 further exacerbates the heat exchange issue. Fixing this is relatively  	 simple: purchase a fin comb from an air conditioning wholesaler and it  	 should straighten them back out easily.</p>  <h3>Seal Your Windows</h3>  <p>The cracks around your windows and doors are the leading causes of air  	 leaks in your home. Air leaks allow unwanted hot air from outside in and  	 the air your system worked to cool out. Leaky doors and windows make your  	 system have to work much harder to keep up||||| which decreases its longevity  	 and increases your utility bills. Check your insulation and weather stripping  	 annually||||| and replace any worn or cracked seals.</p>  <h3>Get Regular Maintenance Service</h3>  <p>While some forms of air conditioning maintenance is simple||||| it&rsquo;s  	 strongly advised that you have your system checked and maintained by a  	 professional who can help you diagnose any issues that may become serious.  	 An annual maintenance service performed at the start of peak use season  	 can ensure your system runs at its maximum efficiency||||| which lets you  	 save energy and extends the life of your system for as long as possible.</p>  <p>  	<em>Since 1969|||||  		<strong>Summers&trade; Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling</strong> have provided high quality heating and air conditioning maintenance and  		 repair services to thousands of customers.

Do they want an electric or gas stove? Should  	 they have a tub/shower combo or a walk-in shower? While these are some  	 of the more common things homeowners think about||||| there are some things  	 that they normally wouldn&rsquo;t consider||||| such as a traditional water  	 heater vs. a tankless water heater.  </p>  <p>There are some key differences that homeowners must understand regarding  	 each type of water heater. The information below can help you determine  	 which type of water heater is right for you.</p>  <h2>Traditional Water Heaters</h2>  <p>These are the big tanks you often find in a closet or the garage of a home.  	 It has a furnace that heats and stores water until it is ready to be used.  	 It triggers once the faucet is turned on and may take some time to heat  	 up||||| causing delayed access to hot water. It also requires the use of more  	 energy and gas to heat the water up. Because the water sits inside the  	 metal tank for extended periods of time||||| it can also cause rust to form|||||  	 which can sometimes travel through the pipes and into the shower or sink.  	 This can be quite troublesome for homeowners to endure.</p>  <h2>Tankless Water Heaters</h2>  <p>Tankless water heaters are much smaller||||| usually just involving a panel  	 on the wall were the traditional water heater once was. This system creates  	 an instant and endless supply of hot water. This means no waiting||||| and  	 a big savings on utility bills due to less energy being used to heat the  	 water. These units also avoid the rust of a traditional water heater and  	 cost less to maintain and repair. Additionally||||| tankless water heaters  	 allow for more storage space in the area where the tank used to sit. Tankless  	 water heaters are most often the more effective option because it helps  	 save time||||| money||||| and space.</p>  <p>No matter which option the homeowner chooses||||| it is important to make sure  	 a professional plumber is there to help whenever something needs to be  	 installed or repaired. At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| our  	 knowledgeable Ohio and Indiana plumbing experts can assist you with the  	 installation of a tankless water heater or repair your traditional water  	 heater. We can help you with the right fix no matter what your needs.</p>  <p align=""center"">  	<strong>Need  		<a href=""/services/plumbing/"">plumbing services</a> for your water heater?  		<a href=""/contact-us/"">Call our team today.</a></strong>  </p></span>"

There are a number of  	 factors to consider including the size and strength of your unit||||| the  	 size of the house||||| whether or not you have central air||||| and more. There  	 are also other potential issues that could slow the process of cooling  	 your home of which you should be aware.  </p>  <p>One potential issue could be dirty filters or air vents. When these items  	 get dirty||||| they can prevent air flow and block the cold air from getting  	 into your home. This means it will take longer for your home to cool down|||||  	 using more energy and forcing your air conditioning unit to work harder.  	 To remedy this||||| you should make sure you clean or change your filters  	 regularly to ensure they are allowing the maximum amount of airflow through  	 the vents and into your home.</p>  <p>Another issue could be the condenser coils not being maintained adequately.  	 If the condenser coil is dirty and not cleaned regularly||||| it can reduce  	 the performance of the system and shorten its lifespan due to the extra  	 work it must perform. This is the part of the air conditioning unit that  	 removes the heat from the refrigerant.</p>  <p>If it is taking a long time for your home to cool down||||| you may also have  	 air leaks or cracks in windows||||| sills||||| doors||||| or other locations in the  	 home. This means that the hot air from the outside is able to enter the  	 home more freely. It also means the cold air your air conditioning unit  	 is producing is able to slip outside||||| making it more difficult for your  	 home to reach your desired temperature.</p>  <p>  	If you are experiencing this issue||||| you may have a few options. Our  	<a href=""/services/cooling/"">Indiana and Ohio air conditioning technicians</a> can come out and check your unit as well as the rest of your home to determine  	 the exact cause of the problem. If we notice it is an issue with the unit  	 itself||||| we can provide the repairs and offer maintenance services so you  	 do not experience the same problem in the future. If it is an issue with  	 another part of the home||||| we can help with insulation or sealing air gaps.  </p>  <p>At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we have the experience and skills  	 to successfully help you keep your house cool and comfortable.

The only thing you want to do right now is take  	 a shower. When you go to take your shower||||| the water comes out||||| but the  	 pressure you&rsquo;re accustomed to just isn&rsquo;t there. In fact||||| the  	 water pressure is so low it is making it difficult for you to shower completely.  	 Unfortunately||||| this is a common problem for a lot of homeowners and there  	 are a number of factors that can cause it. Before you can seek the right  	 fix||||| you should know some of the reasons your water pressure is coming out low.  </p>  <h3>Corroded Pipes</h3>  <p>Despite the estimated life time of piping systems||||| there are natural elements  	 that can cause corrosion inside of the pipes. When this happens||||| it blocks  	 the flow of water. This is something that may happen over the years||||| but  	 you should know that repair is difficult. It may be necessary for the  	 homeowner to hire someone to replace the pipes. This can be a solution|||||  	 but it may need to be done a few times over the course of the entire lifetime.</p>  <h3>Leaks In the Pipes</h3>  <p>It can be difficult to determine the exact location of the leak||||| but if  	 it exists anywhere piping system||||| it can reduce the water pressure in  	 your home. The water would not be flowing to the correct place||||| letting  	 out some of the water that should be in your home. To check for a leak|||||  	 shut off all sources of water in your home and monitor the meter. If after  	 a few hours you have noticed a change||||| there may be a leak in the pipes.  	 A plumber can repair the leak to help improve the water pressure.</p>  <h3>Debris and Mineral Buildup</h3>  <p>Due to various reasons||||| there are many different types of debris and minerals  	 that can build up in your pipes and impact the flow of water. This is  	 most common when there is a fracture in the main water line. Another potential  	 cause is the deposits that are left behind as water passes through the  	 pipes. It doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of debris and mineral buildup to lower  	 the water pressure. If debris and minerals are causing the issue||||| there  	 may be a way to help remedy the situation||||| including using chemicals that  	 will flush the elements out of the line.</p>  <h3>Bad Pressure Regulator</h3>  <p>A pressure regulator is used on the home to make sure water pressure is  	 per the owner&rsquo;s desire. It is usually preset to the right pressure  	 and doesn&rsquo;t normally need to be adjusted. However||||| if you notice  	 that your water pressure is low||||| it could mean that the pressure regulators  	 is bad and is no longer working as it should. You should make sure you  	 speak with a professional plumber to fix the issue because if you mess  	 it up||||| it could cause further problems with your water flow.</p>  <h2>Find the Right Fix with Our Indiana &amp; Ohio Plumbers</h2>  <p>  	When you need help fixing low water pressure||||| you should reach out to a  	 professional who can help you find the right fix. At Summers Plumbing  	 Heating &amp; Cooling||||| our team has the knowledge||||| skill||||| and experience  	 to help you determine the cause of the low water pressure and come up  	 with the perfect solution for you.

You&rsquo;re  	 thinking of your air conditioner and what you would do if the unit broke  	 down or stopped working. While this is perfectly reasonable to do &mdash;  	 your air conditioner is||||| after all||||| very important in the summer &mdash;  	 you should also give some sort of thought to your heater and furnace.  	 There may be some people who feel that if it is not being used||||| then it  	 shouldn&rsquo;t be touched||||| but the truth is that maintenance is very  	 important. Our  	<a href=""/services/heating/"">Indiana and Ohio heating technicians</a> explain why you should always keep the heating in mind.  </p>  <h2>Why Maintain Your Heater?</h2>  <p>As the summer begins to come to an end and the fall weather starts to set  	 in||||| you may start to consider using your heater again. However||||| what do  	 you do when the cold weather finally arrives and you go to turn on the  	 heater||||| only to find that it does not work? This happens far too often  	 because during the summer months||||| something may go wrong with the heater  	 and it was never checked. Now||||| when it is needed||||| it won&rsquo;t work  	 the way you want it to and you&rsquo;ll have to call for a repair or replacement.  	 This is a situation that can be prevented as long as you properly maintain  	 your unit during the off season.</p>  <p>There are a few steps you may be able to take during the summer to make  	 sure your heater will work when it is needed. You can also determine if  	 the maintenance is something you can do on your own or if you need a professional  	 to help you.</p>  <h2>Performing Maintenance by Yourself</h2>  <p>While you may not be able to get to the core of every problem||||| you can  	 help make sure that your heater or furnace is prepared for the winter  	 by regularly changing the filter. You will also want to make sure that  	 the air is circulating correctly in your home by checking your vents.  	 While it may be hot||||| you should turn on the furnace for a few moment just  	 to check and see if it is working and to make sure there are no unusual  	 noises coming from the furnace. Give the areas you can see a quick clean  	 as well||||| removing any dust and dirt from visible locations.</p>  <h2>Professional Maintenance</h2>  <p>Hiring a professional can go further than a simple cleaning or filter replacement.  	 A heating technician can clean the places you can&rsquo;t see||||| check the  	 parts of the furnace for any issues||||| test the airflow||||| examine the air  	 duct||||| and make sure all moving parts are lubricated. The professional  	 can also make sure that the furnace is safe for use in every aspect||||| making  	 sure potential carbon monoxide dangers are addressed. By making sure you  	 provide this general maintenance on a regular schedule||||| you can be sure  	 that you will have a working unit when the cold weather returns.</p>  <h2>Call Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling</h2>  <p>When you need a skilled professional to help you with any of your heating  	 issues||||| we encourage you to reach out to our team and learn what sets  	 us apart from the rest.

The bathroom  	 can take a lot of damage if people are not careful with the various things  	 they may tend to do. Before you go flushing just about anything down the  	 toilet or avoiding to watch out for that hair in the shower||||| make sure  	 you know what damage it can cause and what you can do to help prevent  	 it from becoming such an expensive issue.  </p>  <h2>Allowing Long Hair to Go Down the Drain</h2>  <p>As much as may dislike dealing with it||||| make sure you are taking precautions  	 from allowing your hair to go down the drain. By using a drain stop||||| you  	 can keep that long hair from going down the drain and causing a big problem  	 in the pipes. As hair goes down the drain||||| combining with the soap scum|||||  	 dirt||||| and every other item that goes into the pipes||||| you will start to  	 notice the stoppage it creates. This means your tub won&rsquo;t drain  	 nearly as effective.</p>  <h2>Ignoring Hard Water</h2>  <p>Have you ever noticed that your showerhead or faucet is starting to develop  	 some white||||| chalky substance around the openings? This may be an indicator  	 that you have hard water in your pipes. This has the potential to cause  	 corrosion and damage your pipes||||| showerhead||||| faucet||||| and other important  	 components. You may need to install a water softening system to help combat  	 the problem.</p>  <h2>Using Liquid Drain Cleaner</h2>  <p>Drano. Plumbr. These might be some of your first thoughts when you realize  	 you have a clogged drain. While they do work for several clogs||||| they are  	 not the most effective method||||| nor are they safe for the environment.  	 They can also cause serious damage to the pipes due to the chemicals inside.  	 If you have a clogged drain||||| the most effective method for you to take  	 is to snake the drain. This will remove the obstruction and allow for  	 a more eco-friendly method.</p>  <h2>Allowing a Lot of Steam</h2>  <p>While it is always nice to relax with a hot shower||||| you should know that  	 all that steam you&rsquo;re creating can do a massive amount of damage  	 to the walls and ceiling above. How? It can create mold. If you notice  	 that mold is beginning to form||||| you must treat it right away to get rid  	 of it as it can cause health problems. To help prevent the mold from forming  	 in the first place||||| crack windows or doors||||| or run your fan during and  	 after your shower to help remove the moisture.</p>  <h2>Using the Toilet Like a Trash Can</h2>  <p>Remember what your toilet is used for and don&rsquo;t stray away from that.  	 Way too often||||| people use the toilet for items that should go in the trash.  	 Keep in mind||||| the toilet is built to withstand only a few certain items|||||  	 not that paper towel you used to dry your hands or those wet wipes you  	 used to clean the counter. Flushing these types of items down the drain  	 can cause a serious clog and require a fix to your pipes.</p>  <p>  	If you have a clogged drain and need help with the right fix|||||  	<a href=""/contact-us/"">call Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling</a>. Our team is dedicated to making sure your home is set up so you don&rsquo;t  	 have to deal with these issues in the future.

When you&rsquo;re  	 done with your meals at the end of the day||||| you can usually use the garbage  	 disposal to mash up whatever is left to avoid leaving a mess in the sink.  	 Unfortunately||||| there are some things that don&rsquo;t work quite as well  	 with a garbage disposal because they don&rsquo;t break up that easy. There  	 are plenty of food items that will quickly chop and wash down the pipes|||||  	 but there are others that make this a more difficult task and should instead  	 be thrown away in the trash. Here are six items you should never put down  	 the garbage disposal.  </p>  <h2>Coffee Grounds</h2>  <p>We wanted to put coffee grounds first because they are often thought of  	 as easy to go down the drain. While they may look that way||||| coffee grounds  	 can easily pile up together||||| making more of an obtrusion than they appear.  	 When wet and piled together||||| coffee grounds can become sludge-like and  	 block the drain pipes.</p>  <h2>Fruit Pits</h2>  <p>If you have ever gone to cut up a fruit like a peach||||| you know how difficult  	 it is to chop through the pit. The same can be said for an avocado seed.  	 Now imagine trying to put that down your garbage disposal. Odds are you  	 will just see the pit or seed spinning around in the garbage disposal|||||  	 and there is a good chance you can damage the blades.</p>  <h2>Bones</h2>  <p>After you eat your chicken||||| steak||||| or any other meat connected to a bone|||||  	 the best option is to put the bones in the trash. If you put them down  	 the garbage disposal||||| they&rsquo;ll most likely just spin around and wear  	 down the blades. Even if they do make it past the blades||||| they could cause  	 serious damage to the pipes.</p>  <h2>Grease</h2>  <p>The effects of grease on a garbage disposal may have you calling a plumber  	 for help. This is because grease can result in the blades developing a  	 film and make them not as effective as you would like. It can result in  	 a bad smell and eventually cause a clog in your drains once it begins  	 to solidify.</p>  <h2>Pasta and Rice</h2>  <p>Similar to when you are cooking them||||| pasta and rice both absorb water|||||  	 causing them to swell and get thicker. The more you pour down your garbage  	 disposal||||| the more likely you are to suffer some kind of clog in the drain  	 and in the blades. Long pastas can also get caught up around the blades  	 and make them more difficult to cut.</p>  <h2>Celery||||| Corn Husks||||| and Potato Peels</h2>  <p>These foods &mdash; and other similar fibrous foods &mdash; can cause the  	 blades to work less effective||||| as well as impact the way the motor works.  	 This is because the strings can wrap around the blades||||| making it more  	 difficult to operate. If you absolutely have to put these foods down the  	 garbage disposal||||| make sure you are not putting in big pieces and you  	 are running cold water before||||| during||||| and after disposing of the food.</p>  <p>  	If you have used your garbage disposal on a food that shouldn&rsquo;t be  	 put down the drain||||| there can be numerous problems to follow such as a  	 clogged drain||||| dull blades||||| and more. If this happens||||| you need a professional  	 on your side who can get to the root of the problem and provide a fix.

While you may  	 want that open kitchen design or the big living room area||||| there are some  	 unseen factors that you want to check. Sure||||| it&rsquo;s a great idea to  	 make sure your home is aesthetically pleasing and has all of the amenities  	 that you want||||| but it&rsquo;s also very important to make sure there are  	 no internal problems that will cost you a lot of money to fix later. This  	 includes making sure you have working||||| functional plumbing which||||| if not  	 done correctly||||| can cause you several issues down the road.  </p>  <p>  	At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| our  	<a href=""/services/plumbing/"">Indiana and Ohio plumbers</a> understand the importance of making sure your plumbing is up-to-date and  	 working perfectly before purchasing the home. Because of this||||| we want  	 to make sure you know what to look for when inspecting your home. This  	 allows you to make sure you have working components||||| everything is right|||||  	 and you get everything you truly want in a home. What&rsquo;s a home if  	 you are unhappy with some of the features? Here&rsquo;s a checklist that  	 you can use to make sure the plumbing in your future home is good to go.  </p>  <h2>Clogs</h2>  <p>Let&rsquo;s get one of the most common issues out of the way first. Not  	 only can clogged drains cause your water to drain slowly||||| backing up into  	 the tub or sink||||| they can also cause your pipes to have problems. Make  	 sure you go through the home and turn on the water in the sinks to see  	 how well they drain. Don&rsquo;t forget to check the tubs and showers  	 as well. Finally||||| flush every toilet in the home to make sure there&rsquo;s  	 nothing backing up the drains and causing an overflow.</p>  <h2>Pipes</h2>  <p>The size of your pipes can help you with your water pressure. Even more  	 important||||| you can see if a plumber can come out to do a video inspection  	 of the pipes. This can help you determine if there is something intruding  	 in the pipes such as tree roots||||| dirt||||| grease||||| and more.</p>  <h2>Water Pressure</h2>  <p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than going to take a shower for the first time  	 in your new home and there not being enough water pressure. This happens  	 a lot and people are left trying to make the fix for themselves after  	 they have already purchased the home. When you are checking out the home|||||  	 make sure you have a chance to turn on the faucets and the shower head  	 to see how strong the water pressure is. They shouldn&rsquo;t be too low  	 or too high.</p>  <h2>Water Heater</h2>  <p>Many people don&rsquo;t think about the water heater. If the home has a  	 traditional tank water heater||||| it is important to check a few of the components.  	 Make sure there&rsquo;s no type of corrosion or rust. Make sure the water  	 heater isn&rsquo;t too old. If so||||| you can ask that they replace it with  	 a newer model or tankless water heater before you purchase the home.</p>  <h2>Pipes in the Basement</h2>  <p>Whether you are checking the basement or the crawl spaces under the home|||||  	 you want to make sure the pipes are not leaking. Leaky pipes near the  	 basement or the foundation of the home can compromise the integrity of  	 the structure. It can make it more susceptible to damage which can cost  	 you a large amount of money down the line.</p>  <h2>Lead</h2>  <p>Does the home have lead pipes? If so||||| stay away! This could be dangerous  	 to both you and your family. This can transfer to the water you use which  	 could harm your health. If possible||||| don&rsquo;t buy a home with lead piping.</p>  <p>  	Making sure your future home is in working order is very important. The  	 more problems you have with your plumbing||||| the more money you will spend  	 on wasted water and repairs. If the home you purchase does have trouble  	 and you need help finding a remedy|||||  	<a href=""/contact-us/"">call our plumbers</a> at Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling. Our team is ready to help you  	 with the right fix so your home is in perfect condition. The plumbing  	 is an important part to not only the comfort you find in your home||||| but  	 also in your sanity so you&rsquo;re not worrying about clogs or breakdowns  	 at all times.  </p>  <p>Good luck in finding the perfect home for you and make sure everything  	 is working the way you want it to.</p></span>"

Oftentimes||||| they start to look at the unit itself to see if  	 they can discover the issue||||| but during the process||||| they may neglect  	 one important component: the filters. Just because your air conditioner  	 isn&rsquo;t blowing air as strong as it once did doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s  	 broken. It could simply be that the filter has compiled dust and dirt|||||  	 which is preventing the air from flowing through as it should. This is  	 a much simpler fix than having to replace a full air conditioning unit.  </p>  <p>At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we believe it&rsquo;s important  	 to know how to change your air conditioning filters||||| as well as how often  	 they need to be changed. If you replace your air conditioning filter regularly  	 and something still goes wrong||||| then you are able to eliminate this as  	 an issue if your air conditioning unit isn&rsquo;t working properly. Before  	 you look into other issues||||| make sure you check and change the filter.  	 Our team can explain how you replace your air conditioning filter and  	 how often it should be changed.</p>  <h2>Replacing an AC Filter</h2>  <p>Before you can even really do anything||||| you need to locate the air filter  	 in your home. Check behind the main vent or somewhere near the unit itself.  	 Remove it and see if the filter is dirty and needs replaced. Once you  	 have located your filter||||| you have to identify what kind it is. Is it  	 fiberglass||||| pleated||||| media||||| or any other kind of filter? This information  	 often lets you know how often they should be replaced. Now that you know  	 what kind of filter you need||||| you can go buy a new filter from the store.</p>  <p>Once you get back||||| make sure you properly install the new filter back into  	 place. Follow the instructions included with the new filter to make sure  	 it&rsquo;s on correctly. If you did it properly||||| you will be able to turn  	 on the air conditioner and it should feel like new again. In some units|||||  	 such as window units||||| the filter is usually located right behind the area  	 where the cool air comes out. If you are not replacing these types of  	 filters||||| make sure you clean them at least once a month to prevent a backup  	 of dirt and dust.</p>  <h2>How Often to Change an AC Filter</h2>  <p>Now that you know how to change your AC filter||||| you should know how often  	 to change it so your air conditioner can work at an optimal level. There  	 are a number of factors to consider that can change the amount of time  	 needed before you have to change your filter. First||||| there are different  	 types of filters and they usually have manufacturer recommendations on  	 how often to change them. However||||| if you have bad air quality in your  	 area||||| this may necessitate a change more often. This is true in areas  	 with excessive air pollution or if there is construction nearby that could  	 put dust and dander through your system and attach onto the filter.</p>  <p>If you have allergies||||| pets||||| or a large number of people in the home||||| these  	 are all factors that could shorten the amount of time you have to change  	 a filter. For people with allergies||||| there are various allergens that  	 can build up on the filter and the longer you leave it||||| the more susceptible  	 you are to them. With the amount of hair pets have||||| this can also be clogging  	 your filter and causing the air to work at a less than optimal rate.</p>  <p>If you are struggling to change your air conditioner filter||||| or if you  	 have changed the filter and determined that it is not the problem||||| we  	 encourage you to call our HVAC team at Summers Plumbing Heating &amp;  	 Cooling. We have been serving Indiana and Ohio with excellent service  	 since we opened our doors. We understand how bad air quality can affect  	 a home and how dirty or bad air filters can cause your air conditioning  	 unit to work harder and use more energy.

You clean your home||||| make sure your appliances are working||||| and do some  	 yard work. This is all great||||| but do you ever think of the &ldquo;behind-the-scenes&rdquo;  	 heroes of your home||||| such as the  	<a href=""/services/plumbing/"">plumbing</a>? This is something that not many people consider until something goes  	 wrong. However||||| it&rsquo;s important to know that you don&rsquo;t have  	 to wait for problems to occur. Instead||||| you can take steps to prevent  	 your drains from getting clogged in the first place.  </p>  <p>At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| our plumbers have been serving  	 customers in Ohio and Indiana with the best in plumbing services. We know  	 how to help you prevent your drains from getting clogged||||| but if it is  	 too late for that||||| we can provide the right fix. It is important to take  	 the measures necessary to keep your drains working properly and cleaning  	 them so they don&rsquo;t break down later. Allowing your drains to clog  	 can result in plenty of future problems. Don&rsquo;t let this happen.  	 Our team provides five ways to keep your drains clog-free:</p>  <h2>1. Avoid Putting Certain Items Down the Drain</h2>  <p>One of the things people do without thinking about it is putting grease  	 and coffee grounds in the sink and rinsing them down the drain. Instead|||||  	 dispose of them in different ways. Use an old coffee can for grease and  	 to dispose of it later. For coffee grounds||||| throw them in the trash. These  	 types of items can cause damage as well as clogs to your drains.</p>  <h2>2. Use a Stop to Cover Drain Openings</h2>  <p>Whether in the shower or the bathroom sink||||| it is important to use a drain  	 stop or mesh to prevent hair||||| soap scum||||| and more from going down your  	 drain. With enough hair or other debris||||| your drains can become seriously  	 clogged and cause plenty of problems.</p>  <h2>3. Run Hot Water After Each Use</h2>  <p>Unfortunately||||| some people put their grease and food down the drain and  	 just stop the water. This can cause these items to sit and build up in  	 your drain. This can make the drain sluggish and make water back up. After  	 you are done using the sink||||| run hot water for a bit longer to make sure  	 the items are pushed through the drain.</p>  <h2>4. Regularly Clean</h2>  <p>Make sure you take steps to clean your drains. This will not only help  	 to rid of food and debris||||| but can also help make it smell better. For  	 instance||||| you can use baking soda as a cleaning agent. It will help with  	 odor. You can also use vinegar because it acts as an organic solvent to  	 break down crud in the pipes.</p>  <h2>5. Don&rsquo;t Exclusively Rely On the Garbage Disposal</h2>  <p>For homeowners who exclusively rely on their garbage disposal||||| they are  	 wasting water and energy||||| as well as putting excess food and sticky items  	 down the train. It may be beneficial to create a compost bin that can  	 help you with either your gardening||||| or you can take it to another community  	 garden to use.</p>  <p>  	If your drains are clogged and you need to take action quickly|||||  	<a href=""/contact-us/"">call on our team of plumbing experts</a> in Indiana and Ohio. At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we have  	 the in-depth knowledge of how pipes work in a home and we can use our  	 experience to work and find the resolution that best fits your situation.

Our  	<a href=""/services/cooling/"">AC technicians</a> have the skill and experience to provide customers with the resolution  	 they need when they need it most. Unfortunately||||| there are times when  	 air conditioners stop running in the heat of the summer.

We want to explain the many issues that can cause  	 your air conditioner to stop working. By understanding what&rsquo;s wrong|||||  	 you can troubleshoot the problem. If the issue is more than you feel you  	 can handle on your own||||| you can trust that you can call our team and we  	 will be there for you when you need us most.</p>  <h2>Why Isn&rsquo;t My Air Conditioner Running?</h2>  <p>When we receive a call to work on a broken air conditioner||||| there are a  	 number of steps we can take to determine the cause of the problem. First|||||  	 we want to make sure that the thermostat is working. This controls the  	 temperature in the room and if it is not working||||| the air conditioner  	 may not run. This could be as simple as the thermostat&rsquo;s batteries  	 dying or something worse||||| such as wiring problems. Once we confirm whether  	 or not the thermostat is the problem||||| we can move on to the next component  	 which is the system itself.</p>  <p>The air conditioning unit has numerous parts that make it work the way  	 it does. All of these are necessary in order for your air conditioner  	 to work effectively. We may check the evaporator coils to make sure that  	 nothing is wrong and heat exits the home. Our team can also check and  	 make sure the air conditioner compressor is not broken. This is the component  	 that squeezes the refrigerant. These are crucial parts to keep your home cool.</p>  <p>Another problem could be wiring if there was heavy rain or extreme weather  	 conditions and your air conditioning unit is not protected properly. This  	 can cause damage to the wiring or other parts of your unit that may force  	 it to not work.</p>  <h2>Why Isn&rsquo;t My Air Conditioner Cooling My House?</h2>  <p>In some situations||||| you may hear your air conditioner turn out||||| but it  	 just isn&rsquo;t giving out the cool air to reach the desired temperature.  	 Not only does this make your unit work harder &mdash; which could cause  	 future issues &mdash; but it also increases the energy use in your home.  	 There are a number of reasons this can happen and it&rsquo;s important  	 to understand why.</p>  <p>One thing that could potentially affect your air conditioner&rsquo;s ability  	 to cool your home is dirty air ducts or filters. With dust||||| dirt||||| and  	 other elements clogging up the ducts and air filters||||| the cool air is  	 not passing through into the home. This is not only keeping you from reaching  	 the desired temperature in your home||||| but bad air quality is also potentially  	 dangerous for anyone inside the home.</p>  <p>Another element that could prevent your air conditioner from cooling your  	 home completely is bad insulation or gaps in windows or doors. Any time  	 the heat from outside comes into the home||||| it combats with the cold air.  	 Proper insulation is designed to keep out the hot temperatures during  	 the summer and keep your cool air inside. You can check the insulation  	 and have it replaced if it is not sufficient. You can also close any gaps  	 in your doors and windows so the cold air does not escape your home.</p>  <p>  	If your air conditioner is not working the way it should or it has stopped  	 working completely||||| we can help. We aim to provide the AC service and  	 repairs you need. Our team can determine the problem and provide a fix.  	 If the unit is beyond repair||||| we will work to provide you with the options  	 to replace the unit with a newer||||| more efficient air conditioner. Don&rsquo;t  	 go through the summer dealing with the hot temperatures when you can stay  	 cool in the comfort of your own home. When you need air conditioner repair  	 or replacement in Ohio or Indiana||||| we are the team you can trust to get  	 the job done right.  	<a href=""/contact-us/"">Call today.</a>  </p></span>"

Our  	<a href=""/services/"">HVAC technicians</a> are more than prepared to help customers throughout Ohio and Indiana with  	 all their needs to make sure they are ready to keep cool this summer.  </p>  <h2>1. Check Insulation and Air Filters</h2>  <p>When you really break down the way an air conditioner works||||| you would  	 understand why insulation and air filters are such big factors in keeping  	 your home cool. Some individuals may feel that once they turn on the air  	 conditioner||||| it&rsquo;s going to work no problem. However||||| without proper  	 air filters or insulation||||| you may not experience the cool air you need.  	 A dirty air filter can prevent the cold air from passing through into  	 the home||||| and bad insulation can let heat from the outside in while letting  	 the cold air out||||| making your air conditioner work harder. This could  	 cause an increase in energy bills and potential problems in the future.</p>  <h2>2. Consider a Programmable Thermostat</h2>  <p>You set the thermostat in the morning||||| you go about your day||||| and you come  	 home to the air conditioner still running. This is great for keeping a  	 cool home||||| but it can do a lot of damage to your energy bill. Not only  	 that||||| your unit is working more often and may need maintenance or repairs  	 more often as a result. A programmable thermostat will allows you to adjust  	 the temperature so the air conditioner isn&rsquo;t running too much while  	 you are gone and keeps you comfortable when you&rsquo;re home.</p>  <h2>3. Think About Your Air Ducts</h2>  <p>Most people may not even think twice about their air ducts and how they  	 can affect their home. They should know that these are actually very important|||||  	 because they can affect more than just your home; they can impact the  	 health of your family. This may be a bit confusing to some||||| but air ducts  	 are often home to dust||||| pollen||||| dirt||||| allergens||||| bacteria||||| and more. When  	 you turn your air on||||| these things can get picked up by the airflow and  	 enter your home causing trouble for your entire family. By properly cleaning  	 the air ducts||||| you can eliminate the bacteria and use your air conditioning  	 without worrying about bacteria flying around in your home.</p>  <h2>4. Energy Efficient Options</h2>  <p>Is your home sporting an older air conditioning unit? Does it sometimes  	 break down on you or require a lot of repairs? This is the perfect time  	 to consider some more energy efficient options to install in your home.  	 You can install an energy efficient air conditioning unit that can work  	 better and save you money on expensive bills. There are plenty of options  	 out there||||| and if you combine them with a programmable thermostat you  	 can make sure your home stays cool and keep your energy costs low.</p>  <h2>5. Perform Regular Maintenance</h2>  <p>Your air conditioner unit may sit for a long period of time in the cold  	 winter||||| so before you turn it on again||||| you need to make sure that it&rsquo;s  	 ready to go. This means performing regular maintenance on it and having  	 a professional check it out||||| not just taking a quick look. A professional  	 HVAC technician can take the time to check the unit itself as well as  	 all components such as condensing coils||||| filters||||| the fan||||| and more. During  	 the winter||||| dirt can build up on the components&mdash;especially if not  	 covered properly&mdash;and can make it more difficult for your air conditioning  	 to actually work. This requires cleaning before running the unit so it  	 doesn&rsquo;t waste energy and cause issues.</p>  <p>There are a number of other ways you can make sure your home is ready for  	 the summer such as fixing any leaks in windows||||| caulking around doors|||||  	 using fans in certain rooms||||| and making sure your windows have the optimal  	 coverings &mdash; inside or out. Whichever way you choose to keep the  	 heat out||||| you may benefit from reaching out to a professional team of  	 HVAC technicians who can explain the best options for you.</p>  <p>  	At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we know what it takes to get  	 your home cool in the summer and keep it there. We also want to make sure  	 you don&rsquo;t have to pay an excessively high energy bill and / or deal  	 with the trouble of bad indoor air quality. When you call us||||| you can  	 trust that the team coming to help you is dedicated to making sure you  	 are happy with everything we do.  	<a href=""/contact-us/"">Call our company</a> for HVAC service in Ohio or Indiana and experience the Summers difference.  </p>  <p><strong>Related Stories:</strong></p>  <ul>  	<li><a href=""/blog/2015/august/air-conditioning-tips-to-help-you-stay-cool-this/"" target=""_blank"">Air Conditioning Tips to Help You Stay Cool this Summer</a></li>  </ul></span>"

We use water  	 for cooking||||| cleaning||||| and drinking. One of the main avenues of obtaining  	 our water comes from our water line. The water line is crucial to both  	 homes and commercial residence. You want to make sure you protect it from  	 external and internal threats.</p>  <p>Whether you&rsquo;ve lived in your home for years or are looking to buy  	 a new one||||| be wary of threats to your water pipes. To help you understand  	 the dangers||||| we list some of the common elements that harm your water lines.</p>  <h2>Four Main Threats to Your Water Pipes</h2>  <p>  	<strong>Lime Scale</strong>  	<br> Lime scale build up is one of the leading dangers to your water line.  	 If you live in an area with hard water||||| the high content of calcium and  	 magnesium can accumulate on your pipes creating lime scale. Over time|||||  	 this can block water flow and limit the how much you get. Make sure to  	 take care of lime scale before it hardens permanently.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>Trees</strong>  	<br> While trees may be a great source of oxygen and had beauty to your landscape|||||  	 they can be a nuisance to your water pipe. The tree roots naturally gravitate  	 towards moist soil. If your water line has a leak water or creates condensation  	 that soaks into the surrounding soil||||| tree roots will grow in the direction  	 of the pipes and sometimes penetrate or break the line.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>Corrosion</strong>  	<br> Chemicals (i.e. chlorine) used to keep municipal water clean may erode  	 the pipes on the main water line. This can weaken certain areas||||| causing  	 water leaks.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>Old Pipes</strong>  	<br> Just like many things||||| pipes suffer the passage of time. The National  	 Association of Water Companies report that nearly half the pipes in the  	 United States is in poor condition. Older piper are more susceptible to  	 bursts and leaks. Make sure to check the quality of your pipes.  </p>  <p>  	At  	<a href=""/fort-wayne/"">Summers of Fort Wayne</a>||||| we care about your  	<a href=""/fort-wayne/services/plumbing/"">plumbing</a>!

If unmonitored||||| the heavy rainfall can cause flooding. Many homes install  	 sump pumps to help regulate the water levels during winter. However||||| if  	 you do not have a sump pump or it is not working||||| water can start filling  	 up your basement. If you do experience a basement flood||||| it can be messy.  	 Here are some tips on how to deal with it.</p>  <h2>Cleaning Up After a Flood</h2>  <p>  	<strong>Shut Off the Power to the Basement</strong>  	<br> You should turn off any power sources to the flooded area. The surplus  	 of water can create electric static and cause shock or fires. Do not clean  	 the basement without ensuring that all outlets and wires are covered.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>Remove Items in the Room</strong>  	<br> Once the power is off||||| start taking items out of the flooded room. Start  	 with any electrical devices||||| as they are most susceptible to water damage.  	 Then move on to other furniture||||| carpets||||| and more. You want the area  	 to be clear so you can focus on the water.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>Move Out the Water</strong>  	<br> This can be the tricky part. If the flooding is relatively low||||| you can  	 clean it up using a bucket||||| towels||||| and a mop. However||||| if there is a  	 lot of flooding||||| you may have to use a water pump or wet / dry vacuum.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>Dry the Area</strong>  	<br> Once the weather is calmer||||| open windows||||| open fans||||| and use floor dryers  	 to help dry the room. You want to make sure that all the moisture is out  	 to prevent future problems.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>Disinfect and Clean the Basement</strong>  	<br> Because you can&rsquo;t be sure where the water came from &mdash; drains  	 or sewer &mdash; it is important to clean and disinfect the whole room.  	 This can help you ensure that everything dried properly as well||||| so you  	 don&rsquo;t have mold later on.  </p>  <p>  	If you have problems with flooding||||| contact our  	<a href=""/lafayette/"">Lafayette plumbers</a>.

Like you did when winter started||||| it is important to prepare  	 your plumbing for the spring.</p>  <p><strong>Things to look for during the spring: </strong></p>  <ul>  	<li>  		<strong>Inspect Your Pipes &ndash; </strong>The winter can take a toll on your pipes. The cold weather can compromise  		 the effectiveness of the plumbing. As the weather warms up||||| check to see  		 if your pipes have any cracks or leaks. If you do find a pipe has burst|||||  		 shut off your water.

It is important to clear it out before the spring showers settle  		 in. The gutters serve to redirect the rain water to the appropriate drains.  		 If the water does not drain||||| it can cause flooding in your home and damage  		 the foundation.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Flush the Water Heater &ndash; </strong>Your water heater should be flushed out once a year.

Studies show that roughly 85%  	 of homes in the United States rely on hard water supply. While this form  	 of water is safe to drink||||| it can be punishing on your plumbing and health.  	 Fortunately||||| water conditioning can help!  	<img alt=""water in sink"" src=""/images/water-in-sink[3].PNG"" style=""margin:4px 0px 4px 8px;float:right;width:397px;height:348px"">  </p>  <p>Water conditioning is a process where the minerals such as calcium and  	 magnesium are removed from the water supply. Also known as water softening|||||  	 this method helps prevent the building up of limescale. Most conditioners  	 utilize salt-based systems to counteract the minerals present in hard water.</p>  <p>On average||||| water conditioning costs homeowners anywhere from a couple  	 hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars. Though this might seem like  	 a lot of money||||| it may be worth it for your home! Water conditioning has  	 many benefits that you may not realize.</p>  <h2>Cleaner Plumbing</h2>  <p>The minerals in your water supply leave deposits in your pipes. Over a  	 period of time||||| these scaly deposits build up||||| which can harm your pipes  	 by causing corrosion or clogs. By removing the calcium and magnesium from  	 the water||||| you can make your plumbing run more efficiently.</p>  <h2>Easier Cleaning</h2>  <p>Hard water supply tends to leave soapy residue||||| white spots||||| and streaks  	 on clothes that were recently washed. With less mineral deposits||||| the  	 softer water will clean clothes and dishes more efficiently. Similarly|||||  	 you will find yourself cleaning bathroom tubs||||| sinks||||| and toilets less often.</p>  <h2>Less Mineral Intake</h2>  <p>Your body receives minerals from the food and drinks you ingest. The additional  	 minerals found in hard water may throw off your internal pH balance and  	 have adverse effects on your health. Thus||||| with less minerals in the water  	 supply||||| your body can work more efficiently.</p>  <h2>Helps Personal Grooming</h2>  <p>The minerals in your hard water supply can mix with your soap to create  	 soap curd. This sticky residue will interfere with the way the soap cleans  	 your body and hair. Thus||||| your hair can appear dull and lifeless||||| while  	 your skin becomes drier. Water conditioning can help prevent these negative effects.</p>  <h2>Faster Water Heating</h2>  <p>The calcium and magnesium in the water supply can interfere with the way  	 heat transfers||||| thus making the water heat slower. However||||| the softened  	 water can heat quicker since it does not have the same problems.</p>  <h2>Preserve Appliances</h2>  <p>The minerals in hard water can build up in appliances||||| thus interfering  	 with their efficiency. Water softening systems can help extend the lifespan  	 of appliances such as dishwashers||||| washing machines||||| and water heaters.  	 This can save you time and money.</p>  <p>At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we want to make the most of  	 your home.

It  	 is important to make sure your heater functions properly.</p>  <h2>Common Factors for When Your Heater Blows Cold Air</h2>  <ol>  	<li>  		<strong>Check the thermostat &ndash; </strong>Your thermostat controls the temperature indoors. If your thermostat is  		 set to &ldquo;on&rdquo; the fan will continually blow air||||| even when the  		 furnace is not heating the air. This is a relatively easy fix||||| where all  		 you have to do is switch your thermostat to &ldquo;auto.&rdquo; If your  		 unit is set to a low temperature||||| you may want to increase the degrees  		 to blow warmer air.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Furnace is overheated &ndash; </strong>Check to see if you have dirty filters. If so||||| this will block the air  		 passages on your furnace||||| causing the unit to overheat. When it overheats|||||  		 the limit switch turns the furnace burners off and blows a steady stream  		 of cold air to cool it down. This can be the cause of the cold air.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Pilot light is out &ndash;</strong> The pilot light controls the warmth in your home||||| essentially. Check if  		 your light is on. If not||||| relight the flame. If it still does not light|||||  		 you may have an issue with the gas or the thermocouple. Call a professional  		 to look at your pilot light||||| as it can be dangerous to do without prior  		 knowledge of the unit.  	</li>  </ol>  <p>Don&rsquo;t let a malfunctioning heater ruin your Indiana winter.

The putty may dry out||||| the pipes might crack||||| or the connection might become loose. All of these make leaky drains a possibility. If your drain does leak||||| do not panic. We have compiled steps you can take to fix the problem.</p><h2>Disassemble the Drain</h2><p>In order to fix a leaky drain||||| you will need to disassemble the unit. Before you stress too much about it||||| know that it is not that difficult. First||||| make sure the water is off. Then open the drain with a plumber&rsquo;s wrench. Try to take off the trap fittings with your hand||||| though you may need a screwdriver for help.</p><p>Use an adjustable pipe wrench to loosen and remove the tail pipe. Take out the plastic retainers as well. Once this is done||||| you will have effectively disassembled your drain.</p><h2>Clean the Various Pieces</h2><p>You will need to thoroughly wash all the parts that you just took out. We suggest putting the pieces in a bucket of warm water and baking soda. This will loosen the dirt and putty that cake the pieces. Clean the parts||||| paying close attention to the putty. You want to make sure all of it is off||||| so that it does not interfere with the new putty.</p><h2>Put the Drain Back Together</h2><p>Before you begin the reassembly||||| make sure each part is fully dry. Then||||| apply plumber&rsquo;s putty for each connection around the drain pipe. Lower the drain pipe back into the drain and fit them together. Put the traps and tail pipes back together||||| making sure that all connections are tight. After the drain has been reassembled||||| turn your water back on. Check to make sure there is no longer any leakage slipping past the pipes.</p><p>If you have questions about your leaking drains or need professional help||||| contact our plumbers at Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling.

This can lead to extensive flooding and water damage in  	 homes. That is why many houses have sump pumps installed in their basements.  	 These devices help clear flooded basements of water||||| helping to reduce  	 damage and potential fire hazards. However||||| what happens to the sump pump  	 with excessive flooding? In order to understand how flooding affects a  	 sump pump||||| we need to know how one functions.</p>  <p>A sump pump is a device placed in the lowest point in the home||||| usually  	 the basement. The sump basin catches the water that gathers in the basin.  	 Once the basic is full||||| the floating switch triggers the pump that starts  	 expelling water. The device comes in two forms &ndash; a pedestal and  	 a submersible. A sump pump is effective for helping defend your home from  	 extensive water damage. However||||| flooding does take a toll on the tool.</p>  <h2>Sump Pump Damage and Flooding</h2>  <p>Too much of anything can turn into a bad thing. This is especially true  	 when it comes to excessive flooding in your home||||| particularly in the  	 basement. While many people worry about the damage that water can cause  	 to the basement and other objects in the home||||| few consider the harm a  	 sump pump can experience. Like many other things||||| if overworked||||| flooding  	 can cause plenty of damage to the tool.</p>  <p><strong>Some damages flooding causes you sump pump include: </strong></p>  <ul>  	<li>  		<strong>An overwhelmed sump pump &ndash; </strong>If you have a lot of flooding and only one sump pump||||| the device will have  		 to work harder than usual. The constant use can cause the pump to slow  		 down or stop working because of prolonged usage. If you live in a particularly  		 wet area of Indiana||||| consider getting two sump pumps to lighten the load  		 off that one you have.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Sump pump continues running &ndash;</strong> When your basement has heavy flooding||||| your sump pump may go into overdrive|||||  		 meaning that it constantly runs. This may be a problem when there is no  		 longer any water in the home. You want to make sure that the device stops  		 once the threat of the water is gone.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Clogged sump pumps &ndash;</strong> Flood water tends to carry a lot of debris and particles as it moves across  		 your home. As the pump filters the water out||||| the sump pump lines and  		 switches can become clogged||||| causing the unit to either slow down or break.  		 Make sure your device is clear after you experience a flood.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Lost power &ndash;</strong> Constant movement in your basement or crawlspace where your pump is located  		 can disconnect the pump from the power line. Make sure that the unit is  		 connected to an outlet. However||||| never touch electrical units when there  		 is water present.

(You can always go bigger if the smaller head doesn&rsquo;t work.)</p>  <p>Once you have your tool||||| you are ready to begin. Put on your gloves and  	 place the head of the snake at the opening of the toilet pipe. Slowly|||||  	 but firmly||||| start turning the snake clockwise. As you go deeper in the  	 pipe||||| you will meet resistance. That is the clog. When you feel it||||| wind  	 the snake back. This will most likely cause debris to come up||||| as the  	 clog break. Don&rsquo;t worry||||| you can flush this away later. Repeat the  	 original motion until you no longer feel the clog.</p>  <p>At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we hope this technique helps  	 clear your toilet. However||||| if you need more help||||| our qualified plumbers  	 are waiting and ready to help all throughout Ohio and Indiana. Call today  	 for a free estimate!</p></span>"

There  	 are some moments where you may feel like it will never stop raining. Not  	 only does the weather cause things to get wet||||| it can also damage your  	 home and belongings. Many people try to protect their things by using  	 drains and gutters||||| though that may not be enough. If you do want to help  	 protect your home from water||||| consider having a sump pump installed.</p>  <p>A sump pump is a device that has a basin where excess water goes. Once  	 the basin fills up||||| the pump activates and moves the water out. This helps  	 prevent flooding and water damage. The pump comes in two forms||||| a pedestal  	 and a submersible. It is usually placed in the basement or lowest ground  	 in the home. The device has many great benefits and if you don&rsquo;t  	 have one in your home||||| you should consider installing it.</p>  <h2>The Benefits of a Sump Pump</h2>  <p>  	<strong>1.</strong><strong>Limits the growth of mold / mildew: </strong>Mold and mildew thrive in damp settings. By preventing water to pool and  	 remain stagnant||||| a sump pump helps stop mold and mildew from growing.  	 Not only does this help your home||||| but it can also protect your health.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>2.</strong><strong>Prevents flooding:</strong> As mentioned||||| the sump pump is a great device if your region is prone  	 to rain or near water. Sump pumps will help prevent your home from flooding|||||  	 particularly in the basement||||| where it can be hard to get rid of water.  	 This will save you from extensive damage repairs.  </p>  <p>  	<strong>3.</strong><strong>Reduces the risk of fires:</strong> This may sound like an odd benefit||||| with you wondering how sump pumps  	 affect fires. However||||| it makes sense when you realize that flooding can  	 be one of the reasons fires start. When water seeps into electrical wires  	 and units||||| they can spark and cause fires. By stopping the flooding||||| a  	 sump pump can help prevent fires in your home.  </p>  <p>If you are interested in sump pumps||||| our plumbers at Summers Plumbing Heating  	 &amp; Cooling can help! We offer sump pump services that include installation|||||  	 repair||||| and replacement. Call today to schedule an appointment for your  	 free estimate today!</p></span>"

They offer a respite from the chilly winter weather. There is something  	 so comforting sitting in a heated room while the wind whispers outside.  	 Unfortunately||||| if your heater does not work||||| the winter can seem unbearable|||||  	 especially in Indiana and Ohio. But before you start to freak out||||| take  	 a breath and check to see if any of the following might be a problem.</p>  <h2>Thermostat Issues</h2>  <p>The thermostat controls the temperature inside your home. As such||||| make  	 sure that the dial is turned to heat. You should also check to see that  	 the temperature that is set is at least five degrees higher than the current  	 one. Some thermostats work with batteries||||| so make sure that those are not dead.</p>  <h2>Pilot Light</h2>  <p>Furnaces that work with gas have pilot lights. These flames provide the  	 energy needed to heat a home and must be continuously lit. Check your  	 furnace to make sure this flame has not gone out. Also check to see the  	 strength of the flame. It should be blue||||| and not a weak yellow.</p>  <h2>Problems with Circuit Breaker</h2>  <p>The circuit breaker controls the flow of electricity in your home. Make  	 sure that it has not tripped or blown out. If there is a disturbance to  	 this unit||||| it can affect the way your heater works (or doesn&rsquo;t|||||  	 in this case).</p>  <h2>Check Your Ducts</h2>  <p>If your ductwork system is not properly set up and secure||||| it can cause  	 heat from reaching the main rooms. Make sure the ducts do not have patches  	 that allow hot air to leak. This can cause cold spots in your home.</p>  <h2>Dirty Air Filters</h2>  <p>You should change your air filters regularly. The filters trap debris and  	 particles that move through the air. If these are not changed on time|||||  	 the dirt can build up||||| blocking the regular flow of heat. This can prevent  	 your home from warming up like it should.</p>  <h2>Furnace Maintenance</h2>  <p>Most furnaces usually last up to 30 to 40 years. They need to be properly  	 checked and maintained in order to ensure they work the way they should.  	 If you can&rsquo;t remember the last time you looked at your furnace|||||  	 it might be time now. Your furnace may also need to be replaced if it&rsquo;s  	 at the end of its life. These both can lead to cold homes.</p>  <p>At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we want your winters to be as  	 comfortable as possible. That is why if your heating is not working||||| contact  	 our Indiana and Ohio heating technicians today. We offer free estimates  	 and can help you get your warm home again.

That is why it might be a good idea to set aside funds for any repairs  	 that might be needed in the future. By making a resolution to save money  	 for emergencies||||| you can breathe a little easier in the future.</p>  <h2>Care for Your Air</h2>  <p>People will probably make resolutions to stop themselves from polluting  	 the air. You should go one step further. Make sure that the air you breathe  	 within your home is clean. You can do this by checking your filters and  	 ducts and making sure everything is clean and in order.</p>  <h2>Learn About Your Plumbing</h2>  <p>It can be easy to ignore your plumbing. No one usually pays attention to  	 it unless they have to. This year||||| however||||| try to teach yourself about  	 your pipes and drains. Maybe you know how a faucet functions but have  	 no clue how a toilet works. Take some time to learn! What better time than now?</p>  <p>  	At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we hope you have a great year!  	 We believe you can accomplish all your resolutions!

If you&rsquo;re  	 like us||||| you probably have your ugly Christmas sweater ready to go. You  	 may also spend time lighting menorahs||||| trimming trees||||| and setting up  	 all the gingerbread cookies you are going to be decorating. However||||| just  	 as important as the decorations is checking out your plumbing and heating  	 before the holidays are here. There is nothing worse than having guests  	 over for dinner and having one of your pipes burst. That is why we have  	 listed a few things you should look at before the carols start in full swing.</p>  <h2>Water Heater</h2>  <p>One of the major things people forget to check before winter is their water  	 heater. This should be the first thing you look at because of how often  	 you will need it during the holidays. If you have guests staying over|||||  	 they will probably expect hot water when they shower and wash. That is  	 why it is important you check your water heater before they come over.  	 (No one likes giving that nitpicky family member a reason to complain!)</p>  <h2>Garbage Disposal</h2>  <p>The garbage disposal is another thing that you should look at before the  	 holidays. The kitchen is one of the central areas in which family likes  	 congregating. As such||||| there are numerous times when one family member  	 or friend will be stuffing food down the disposal. That is why it is important  	 that it works properly and is not clogged. Check to make sure your pipes  	 and valves are secure to prevent any future leaks or breaks. One tip to  	 make sure your disposal works properly is to use cold water during and  	 after putting food through. The cold helps the particles and oils stick  	 together rather than against the pipe.</p>  <h2>Toilets</h2>  <p>Toilets are the unsung heroes of a household. They are used multiple times  	 a day without a second thought||||| until one stops working! Before the holidays  	 actually come||||| make sure to check your toilets are functioning properly.

They are like Oompa Loompas at the Willy  	 Wonka factory. You know they are there||||| but you don&rsquo;t pay attention  	 unless something bad happens. But just like with anything||||| your plumbing  	 needs to be routinely checked.</p>  <p><strong>Regular checkups will: </strong></p>  <ul>  	<li>Make your home comfortable</li>  	<li>Potentially lower water and energy bills</li>  	<li>Allow your plumbing to function better||||| for longer</li>  	<li>Prevent future||||| extensive damage</li>  </ul>  <p>Now that we have||||| hopefully||||| convinced you of the merit of checking your  	 plumbing||||| you&rsquo;re probably wondering some of the reasons to do so!  	 It can be easy to forget about checking in with your plumbing. Unlike  	 the dentist&rsquo;s office||||| your pipes do not send you reminder cards.  	 However||||| there are certain signs that can show you that it is time for  	 a plumbing checkup.</p>  <h2>Dripping Faucets</h2>  <p>Are you unable to sleep at night because of that drip&hellip;drip&hellip;drip  	 sound? If your faucets are expelling more water than necessary||||| it might  	 be time for you to check your plumbing. Although not an uncommon problem|||||  	 untreated faucet leaks can lead to higher water bills and future plumbing damage.</p>  <h2>Lower Water Pressure</h2>  <p>Have you turned on your faucet||||| expecting a steady stream of water||||| but  	 only saw a trickle? This can be caused by lower water pressure. This can  	 be caused by a water break in the municipal water supply. It can also  	 be the result of water build up or clogs in your pipes. If you notice  	 low water pressure||||| make sure that your pipes are not clogged.</p>  <h2>Running Toilet</h2>  <p>A toilet usually releases water to the bowl when the flapper moves. However|||||  	 if this does not work properly||||| more water can be released than necessary.  	 This can lead to an overflowing toilet||||| which no one likes dealing with.  	 In order to make sure your toilet functions correctly||||| it is important  	 to check the inner workings in the tank.</p>  <h2>Clogged or Slow Drains</h2>  <p>Have you noticed that the water in your tub is not draining properly after  	 you bathe? A clogged drain can be the culprit. Water usually carries sediment  	 and minerals that can attach themselves to the pipes. Not only that||||| but  	 things like hair and dirt can pass through drains||||| causing them to clog.  	 To ensure proper use||||| make sure to check on your drains regularly to prevent clogging.</p>  <p>At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we want your home to be as comfortable  	 and efficient as possible. That is why we recommend regular checkups.  	 If you are not sure what to look for||||| call one of our experienced plumbers  	 today.

Though these might not be the  	 lyrics you remember from the holiday classic||||| it might be the words you  	 sing if your furnace doesn&rsquo;t turn on! Your furnace is the system  	 that works hard to keep your home warm. With the winter setting in nicely|||||  	 it might be a key to a comfortable holiday season. But what do you do  	 when your furnace doesn&rsquo;t turn on? First thing is don&rsquo;t panic!  	 We&rsquo;re here to help! At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we  	 want you to have the best winter possible. That is why we&rsquo;ve compiled  	 a few things to check in case your furnace is acting finicky.  </p>  <h2>Check the Thermostat</h2>  <p>This might seem too easy of a fix||||| but go check to make sure if your thermostat  	 is on. Sometimes||||| when a house or street loses power||||| the thermostat will  	 automatically turn off. Make sure that it is on. While you are there|||||  	 make sure that it is set to a temperature that you find comfortable. To  	 see if your thermostat might be the reason your furnace is not turning  	 on||||| set the temperature 10 degrees higher and check if your home heats up.</p>  <h2>Check the Circuit Breakers</h2>  <p>The circuit breaker is responsible for monitoring the current of electricity  	 flowing through your home. If it has caused other electrical disturbances  	 in your house||||| it may also prevent your furnace from working. Go to your  	 circuit breaker panel and make sure the switch for the HVAC system is  	 flipped on. If you are having problems with your circuit breaker||||| contact  	 our HVAC technicians for help.</p>  <h2>Check the Condensate Pan</h2>  <p>The condensate pans on your furnace help drain the unit of water that accumulates.  	 If the pan works appropriately||||| it should pump or dispense the water gathered.  	 However||||| if your pan is filled with water||||| it can be what causes your  	 furnace from turning on.</p>  <p>If your pan has a drain||||| make sure it is clean and clear. If it is blocked|||||  	 it will stop the water from flowing through. If your pan has a pump||||| check  	 to make sure the float switch is in the &ldquo;down&rdquo; position. If  	 your float switch is turned up||||| it will stop your furnace.</p>  <h2>Check Your Air Filter</h2>  <p>  	Your  	<a href=""/blog/2015/november/why-should-you-regularly-change-air-filters-/"">air filters</a> should be changed regularly. If they have not||||| they can become clogged  	 or dusty. This can prevent air from passing through. If it feels like  	 your furnace is not working||||| check to see if your filters are clean and  	 allowing the heat through.  </p>  <h2>Check Your Pilot Light</h2>  <p>Check to see if your pilot light is on. If it has gone out||||| relight it.  	 However||||| if it flickers off after||||| it can indicate that the assembly or  	 sensor are dirty.</p>  <h2>Check Your Gas</h2>  <p>If you have a gas furnace||||| make sure that your gas is working properly.  	 To check if it is||||| try lighting your stove or other gas appliances. If  	 they do not turn on||||| there you go! You&rsquo;ve found your problem. However|||||  	 if you smell gas||||| get out of the house quickly and call for immediate  	 repair. Gas leaks can be very dangerous!</p>  <p>We hope these tips help you figure out your furnace needs so that you can  	 enjoy roasting chestnuts by an open fire. If you still experience trouble|||||  	 contact our leading Indiana and Ohio heating technicians. We bring years  	 of knowledge and can find a solution to your HVAC problems.</p></span>"

However||||| when you get down to your basement||||| you notice water leaking from the ceiling. You have not seen it before and wonder where it is coming from. In most cases||||| the shower you took and the leak may be connected. Often times||||| there are many reasons why a shower leak can end up in the basement. Some instances include having the shower directly over the basement or water leaking through the walls. You might wonder why.</p><h2>Shower Pan</h2><p>One of the main reasons a shower leak might lead water into the basement is because of a failing shower pan. Shower pans constitute the ground of the shower and can be made of tile or fiberglass. The latter can be ineffective because the adhesive might come undone or flex if not properly installed. In order to check if the shower pan is the main culprit of the leak||||| block the drain with a stopper or some object. Then||||| fill the shower with water. Go down to your basement and check if you see water stains appear on the ceiling. If you do||||| that can be the cause. However||||| sometimes one may need to cut the ceiling to know for sure. Before making any cuts||||| make sure to consult an experienced plumber in this matter.</p><h2>Faulty Tile Backing or Substrate</h2><p>Another cause for shower leaks that lead to the basement might be the tile backing or substrate. This is the adhesive and material placed behind the tiles to support it. Do you know what adhesive was used when putting in the shower tile? If it is pre-mixed||||| this might cause problems. Also||||| if drywall was used as a backing||||| it can become &ldquo;mushy&rdquo; due to water damage. If these are the problems||||| you may need to reinstall the tile backing and substrate.</p><h2>Broken Pipes and Valves</h2><p>Finally||||| like most leak cases||||| the reason can be a broken valve or pipe. Check the pipes and water valve behind the walls to see if there is a leak. If there is||||| that can be what seeps through the walls and trickles down to your basement.</p><p>Shower leaks can be tricky problems. If you do not know the proper way to diagnose and address the issue||||| extensive damage might occur. Furthermore||||| it is a problem that should be immediately solved. If you do not fix the issue||||| you have to make more repairs that you could have initially avoided. If you believe water from your shower is leaking into your basement||||| contact Summer Plumbing Heating + Cooling. Our experienced Indiana and Ohio plumbers have worked with many similar cases.

However||||| when dirt and dust start accumulating  		 in the filter||||| it can slow or stop airflow. This causes your HVAC unit  		 to work even harder||||| which can take its toll. If left unaddressed||||| dirty  		 air filters can lead to extensive and expensive damage. Changing your  		 air filter is cheap||||| easy||||| and can save you from major repairs.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Save on your energy bill -</strong> When an air filter is dirty||||| it clogs the air passing through the HVAC  		 unit||||| causing the system to work harder. When it works harder||||| it uses  		 more energy||||| which can increase your energy bill. The Department of Energy  		 asserts that the average household annually spends about $2|||||200 on their  		 energy bill. By maintaining clean air filters||||| you can save anywhere from 5-15%.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Clean air quality -</strong> The air in your home circulates through your HVAC system||||| flowing through  		 the air filters. If your filters remain unchanged||||| dust||||| dander||||| and particles  		 gather. These all are spread through your home when you use your heating  		 and cooling system. It is especially prudent for you to change your filters  		 if you have allergies.  	</li>  </ul>  <h2>When to Change Your Air Filters</h2>  <p>Now that we have convinced you the importance of changing your filters|||||  	 hopefully||||| you may be wondering how often you should do it. The answer  	 is: it depends! Each unit is different depending on the various environments.</p>  <p><strong>Things to consider when deciding when to change your filters: </strong></p>  <ul>  	<li>What type of unit do you have? (Some have specific instructions about when  		 to change filters).</li>  	<li>Do you have pets and how many?</li>  	<li>The number of people in your home.</li>  	<li>General air quality / pollution in your area.</li>  </ul>  <p>A good general number to change your filters is every two or three months.  	 At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we want to make sure you have  	 a comfortable home and clean air to breathe. We hope these tips help you  	 maintain clean air filters. If you do have problems with your HVAC system|||||  	 contact our Indiana and Ohio technicians today!</p></span>"

Water is a finite resource||||| which will run out if we are not careful with  	 it. Not only that||||| who doesn&rsquo;t like saving a little extra money?  	 You can use the money you save on your water bill for the vacation you&rsquo;ve  	 wanted to go one||||| your child&rsquo;s education||||| or towards other bills.</p>  <p>Maybe you have already tried tackling the usual culprits of water waste:  	 turning off the faucet when you brush your teeth||||| taking shorter showers|||||  	 and using excess cooking water to water your plants. Yet||||| still you see  	 no difference in your water bill. If your bill doesn&rsquo;t change||||| it  	 might be a matter of hidden leaks in your plumbing. At Summers Plumbing  	 Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we are here to fix your leaks so your water bill  	 isn&#39;t so hard on your wallet! That is why we&rsquo;ve compiled a checklist  	 to help you reduce your water bill.</p>  <h2>Check for Leaking Faucets</h2>  <p>Leaky faucets can seem harmless||||| but if left unrepaired||||| they can cost  	 you a lot of money and waste a lot of water. A faucet that leaks once  	 per second and goes unfixed for a month can waste up to 260 gallons of  	 water. You&rsquo;re spending that money on water you don&rsquo;t even  	 use! Leaky faucets are easy fixes. You can find supplies and help at your  	 local hardware store. Or you can call the plumbers at Summers Plumbing  	 Heating &amp; Cooling.</p>  <h2>Running Toilets</h2>  <p>Toilets leaking water can also adversely affect your water bill. You might  	 be wondering how you could tell for toilet leaks||||| when the toilet is always  	 filled with water. To check for a leak||||| lift the tank and look if the  	 water is spilling into the overflow. Then||||| take food coloring or laundry  	 bluing and place it in the tank. Wait 30 minutes. Come back and look at  	 the water in the bowl. If you see colored water||||| it means you have a leak.  	 Luckily||||| the leak can usually be fixed inexpensively. Our plumbers are  	 ready to help you.</p>  <h2>Check Your Water Meter</h2>  <p>Your meter diagram displays how much water is being used. This device can  	 help you detect &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; leaks that are not apparent||||| and  	 may occur under the home or in the foundational pipes running through  	 the house. To check for these leaks||||| look note the number on the meter.  	 Wait an hour without using any water in the house. Check the meter again  	 and if the number changes||||| it means you have a leak. To fix &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;  	 leaks||||| contact our plumbers at Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling.</p>  <p>  	You should not have to spend money on water you do not use. We hope by  	 detecting leaks in your home and fixing them||||| your water bill will decrease  	 and your wallet will increase. If you do believe water is excessively flowing|||||  	<a href=""/contact-us/"">contact</a> our Indiana and Ohio plumbers for a free estimate today.  </p></span>"

Take a breath and focus. There are steps you can take to stop the  	 flow and make sure it does not happen again. Usually||||| the problem lies  	 within the toilet. In order to figure out what is wrong||||| it is important  	 to understand what a toilet consists of.</p>  <p>A toilet has five primary parts. Lift the lid and identify the following:</p>  <ul>  	<li>Flush lever</li>  	<li>Rubber flapper (device at the bottom that stops the water from flowing  		 into the bowl)</li>  	<li>Water pump</li>  	<li>Float (the round object that moves with the water level and alerts the  		 pump when to fill)</li>  	<li>Overflow tube</li>  </ul>  <p>Once you have identified all the objects||||| you can check to make sure they  	 are all performing properly. If you are hesitant to put your hand in a  	 toilet tank||||| don&rsquo;t worry. The water in there is clean and safe to  	 touch. Of course||||| like many things||||| make sure to wash your hands afterwards!</p>  <h2>Turn Off the Water Source</h2>  <p>Before trying to figure out what is wrong with the toilet||||| we suggest shutting  	 off the water source. You can do this by turning the silver knob at the  	 back of the toilet.</p>  <h2>Problems with the Chain</h2>  <p>One common problem that causes toilets to overflow is a problem with the  	 chain. Jiggle the flush lever to see if the chain is too long or short.  	 If it is too short||||| it will tug the flapper even when the flush lever  	 is not pushed. If it is too long||||| it will interfere with the flapper opening  	 on time. If you do have a problem with the chain||||| you can simply replace  	 it with another aluminum ball chain that is the appropriate length.</p>  <h2>Flapper Not Working</h2>  <p>You can check on the flapper by flushing to drain the water and then unhooking  	 the flapper from its chain. Remove the object to check to see if it has  	 been warped or if there is dirt buildup on it. If the device is warped|||||  	 you should buy a new one to replace it. If there is dirt preventing it  	 from working properly||||| simply try cleaning it off.</p>  <h2>Call an Experienced Plumber</h2>  <p>If you have tried fixing the problem yourself and your toilet still doesn&rsquo;t  	 work properly||||| it may be time to call for help. The knowledgeable plumbing  	 team at Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling is ready to help with all  	 of your toilet needs. Call us at 317-399-5665||||| day or night||||| to schedule  	 a service!</p></span>"

However||||| with the blink of an eye||||| the air has turned chilly|||||  	 the leaves are falling||||| and winter is imminent. Indiana and Ohio are states  	 that can get cold quite fast. You do not want to freeze with the coming  	 frost. That is why we have compiled a list of tips to ensure that your  	 home is warm and that you get through this winter with all your limbs intact.</p>  <h2>1. Check Furnace Filters</h2>  <p>In order for your heating systems to work efficiently||||| you need to change  	 the filters. Each furnace and filters have special instructions on when  	 to change them. Keep those in mind and make sure to replace or clean the  	 filters when they need it. Dirty linings use up more energy and do not  	 heat the home as well as they could.</p>  <h2>2. Block Heat Loss</h2>  <p>Make sure that your doors and windows are well insulated so that heat does  	 not have a chance to escape. You can save warmth by simply blocking cracks  	 in doors and windows with a towel. You can close the blinds||||| keep doors  	 shut||||| and making sure general openings are covered. This will capture  	 the heat||||| making it easier to stay warm.</p>  <h2>3. Maintain Your HVAC System</h2>  <p>While changing your filters||||| make sure that your heating systems are tuned  	 and working properly. You can have an experienced HVAC technician come  	 in and check it out for you. Your central heating works hard during the  	 winter||||| so it is important that it is properly maintained and functioning well.</p>  <h2>4. Have Clean Chimneys</h2>  <p>There is nothing quite as cozy as a well-lit fireplace during the middle  	 of winter. But before you light the logs||||| make sure that your chimneys  	 are clean. The burning wood needs ventilation so that the house does not  	 fill with smoke. However||||| fireplaces can be a great way to stay warm and  	 save money.</p>  <h2>5. Use Natural Light For Warmth</h2>  <p>Although the sun does not come out often during winter||||| when it does||||| you  	 should make the most of it! Open your blinds to let in the sunrays||||| which  	 will naturally heat up your home.</p>  <p>At Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling||||| we want you to have a comfortable  	 and safe winter. We hope these tips will make that happen. For more information  	 or to schedule an appointment with our heating team||||| call today!</p></span>"

They work quietly||||| ensuring that  	 we have fresh water coming into the home and waste getting flushed out.  	 If they work properly||||| we forget they are there||||| working efficiently under  	 the home. However||||| as soon as a pipe breaks||||| leaks||||| or is in any other  	 way damaged||||| it feels like the whole house comes to a standstill. When  	 it comes to pipe repair||||| the two methods to know are pipe bursting and  	 pipe relining.</p>  <h2>What is pipe bursting and how can it help you?</h2>  <p>Pipe bursting is a process in which plumbers can repair underground pipes  	 without having to dig trenches. With pipe bursting||||| the plumbers create  	 two openings: one for inserting and one for receiving the new pipe. Plumbers  	 use a device called an expander head that has the new pipe attached to  	 it. The expander head goes into the existing pipe||||| breaking the old line  	 while laying down the new one.</p>  <p><strong>The benefits of using the pipe bursting method include: </strong></p>  <ul>  	<li>Cost of material is cheaper</li>  	<li>Pipe bursting works very well for old pipes that have lost their integrity  		 (crushed/become oval-shaped)</li>  	<li>The new HDPE pipe used is environmentally sound and non-toxic</li>  </ul>  <h2>What is pipe relining and how can it help you?</h2>  <p>Pipe relining is another method that uses a trenchless technique to repair  	 current pipes. Rather than breaking through existing pipe||||| pipe relining  	 works to repair it. Plumbers go in with an epoxy liner and insert it into  	 the current pipe. The liner will then solidify||||| creating a new pipe within  	 the old pipe. This will clear up the pipe and cause it to work better  	 than before.</p>  <p><strong>The benefits of using the pipe relining method include: </strong></p>  <ul>  	<li>This process only needs one opening for insertion.</li>  	<li>The pipes usually have a life expectancy of 50 years.</li>  	<li>The epoxy resin is markedly stronger than concrete.</li>  </ul>  <p>Whether you decide you want to try pipe bursting or relining||||| contact our  	 experienced plumbers at Summers Plumbing Heating &amp; Cooling.

Whether it is dry heat or warmth filled with humidity||||| one  	 thing is certain||||| your air conditioner becomes your prized possession.  	 In order to maximize your A.C. unit and have the coolest summer yet||||| we  	 have put together some tips for you.</p>  <h2>Your Home Temperature</h2>  <p>It is important to keep track of your home temperature inside||||| so that  	 your air conditioning can work at its best. The average A.C. is designed  	 to cool your home down by 20 degrees. That means that if your home is  	 very hot||||| like 100 degrees||||| then you should expect the temperature to  	 come down to 80 degrees.</p>  <p>Try to set your thermostat to the highest cool temperature that you are  	 comfortable. By making the difference in temperature of outside and inside  	 relatively close||||| you can cut your energy bill down. Also||||| when first  	 turning on your air conditioner||||| it does not help to drop the temperature  	 on the thermostat significantly. The unit will not cool your home any faster.</p>  <h2>Air Filters</h2>  <p>It is important to change the air filters on the air conditioning unit  	 often so that you and your family are not inhaling dangerous toxins and  	 dust. If the filters become particularly clogged||||| it can also affect the  	 effectiveness of the A.C. and how cool your home gets. It is suggested  	 that you change your filters four times a year.</p>  <h2>Keep the Heat Out</h2>  <p>In order for your air conditioning to work at its best||||| your home should  	 be reasonably cool. To keep the heat out||||| close your blinds||||| shades||||| and  	 drapes. It might be worthwhile to note which windows face east and which  	 face west||||| just so you know which ones to close in the morning and in  	 the afternoon. White shades or blinds are particularly helpful in cooling  	 your home because they deflect the sun rays.</p>  <h2>Use Your Fans</h2>  <p>It might seem counterintuitive to use your fans when you have the air conditioning  	 going||||| but the two can work together to cool your home and cut costs.  	 By strategically placing an interior fan next to window A.C. units||||| you  	 can have more cold air flowing through the house. If you have a ceiling  	 fan||||| make sure it is set to &ldquo;forward&rdquo; or moves counter-clockwise  	 to generate and circulate more air.</p>  <p>We hope these tips help you make the most of your air conditioning so you  	 can stay cool this summer! If you do have problems or questions about  	 your A.C.||||| call Summer Plumbing||||| Heating &amp; Cooling today. One of our  	 technicians can help look at your unit and get your home cooler.</p></span>"

Fortunately|||||  	 by choosing the right furnace filter for your heating system you can significantly  	 reduce airborne particles and improve the air inside your home.</p>  <p>--The following section provides more information about the various types  	 of furnace filters that are available so you can make an informed decision  	 about which is the right choice for your home.</p>  <ul>  	<li>  		<strong>Fiberglass furnace filters</strong> are effective at eliminating large particles like dust. However||||| they  		 allow smaller particles like pollen and mold spores to pass through with  		 ease. They are the least expensive style of filter||||| but they are also  		 the least effective at removing debris from the air. Typically these filters  		 are geared more toward protecting your furnace than protecting your health.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Electrostatic filters</strong> have a static charge that attracts particles from the air. They are more  		 effective than fiberglass filters and have the added benefit of not needing  		 to be replaced. Instead||||| you can wash and reuse them.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Pleated air filters</strong> are more effective than either fiberglass or electrostatic filters. The  		 pleats help increase the surface area of the filter so it can trap more  		 particles. These furnace filters are highly effective at removing allergens  		 from the air and are one of the most popular choices for homeowners.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters</strong> are the most effective type of filter. Typically they are used in hospitals  		 and labs where clean air is essential. HEPA filters usually are not recommended  		 for residential use because they restrict air flow and over time can damage  		 your furnace. If you do choose a HEPA filter||||| you should hire an HVAC  		 expert to measure the air flow of your heating system to make sure it  		 is not being restricted by the filter.  	</li>  </ul>  <p>  	For expert advice on improving indoor air quality||||| contact the professionals at  	<a href=""/locations/"">Summers Plumbing Heating and Cooling</a> now servicing 10 Indiana cities and their surrounding areas (  	<a href=""/anderson/"">Anderson-Muncie</a>|||||  	<a href=""/bloomington/"">Bloomington</a>|||||  	<a href=""/indianapolis/"">Broad Ripple-Indianapolis</a>|||||  	<a href=""/brownsburg/"">Brownsburg</a>|||||  	<a href=""/columbus/"">Columbus</a>|||||  	<a href=""/franklin/"">Franklin</a>|||||  	<a href=""/greenfield/"">Greenfield</a>|||||  	<a href=""/kokomo/"">Kokomo</a>|||||  	<a href=""/lafayette/"">Lafayette</a>||||| and  	<a href=""/noblesville/"">Noblesville</a>).  </p></span>"

Annual  	 HVAC-system service is highly recommended &mdash; and necessary &mdash;  	 to ensure optimal performance and safety.</p>  <p>When scheduling your annual HVAC-system service||||| make sure you&rsquo;ve  	 properly assessed your service provider&rsquo;s professional qualifications.  	 There are standards||||| both professional and legal||||| that should be met.  	 Even if your fourth cousin insists he knows all about HVAC systems||||| you  	 could be opening an expensive can of worms if he isn&rsquo;t insured and  	 licensed. In central Indiana||||| Mother Nature can be a harsh mistress; you  	 don&rsquo;t want to be left out in the cold||||| or in the heat.</p>  <p>Fortunately||||| with the Internet||||| opportunities to check on a company&rsquo;s  	 qualifications||||| professional organizational associations and even their  	 record with the public are readily available. With sites like Angie&rsquo;s  	 List and others||||| public feedback for a company&rsquo;s performance can  	 be easily and promptly evaluated. You can find out if an HVAC service  	 provider&rsquo;s customers across town or across the state are pleased  	 or displeased with their experience.</p>  <p>When an HVAC service company is licensed||||| you know that it has been fully  	 recognized as meeting government standards. That company has taken the  	 prudent||||| necessary steps to make sure their technicians are properly trained  	 and have the required job skills.</p>  <p>When a contractor is insured||||| you can rest assured that your property and  	 family are protected.

Though your HVAC  	 system does draw a significant amount of energy||||| it&rsquo;s probably not  	 the only thing spiking your home&rsquo;s bill.</p>  <p>  	Common household electronics||||| such as the television and stereo||||| draw power  	 even when they are turned off. It&rsquo;s important to understand in order  	 to maximize your home&rsquo;s energy savings.  	<strong>What is standby power?</strong>  </p>  <p>Many appliances and electronic devices are equipped with a standby power  	 feature that causes the device to continue to draw power when not in use.  	 Sometimes||||| this power feature has a useful purpose. For example||||| the standby  	 feature is responsible for the clock displays on your DVD player or the  	 program feature on your coffee pot. Other devices||||| like your laptop computer  	 or cell phone charger||||| draw power just by being plugged in. Over time|||||  	 these devices slowly suck power||||| causing you to pay more for your home&rsquo;s  	 energy costs.</p>  <p>Here are some simple steps to reduce your home&rsquo;s wasteful standby  	 power usage.</p>  <ul>  	<li>  		<strong>Use a power strip. </strong>A power strip is an excellent device for combating standby power electronics.  		 Plug all your non-essential electronics into a power strip. Include all  		 electronics that can be turned off without causing a problem like your  		 television||||| stereo equipment||||| toaster oven||||| coffee pot and DVD player.  		 Appliances like your stove or refrigerator need constant power to function  		 properly. At night||||| when leaving for work or going on vacation||||| switch  		 the power strip off. This turns off the electronic devices at the power  		 source||||| killing the standby feature.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Unplug chargers. </strong>Many personal electronics use a wall charger to charge the device&rsquo;s  		 battery. When not in use||||| you may be leaving the chargers plugged into  		 the wall. These chargers continue to draw power||||| even when the device  		 is not plugged in at the opposite end. After charging your personal electronics|||||  		 unplug the charger from the wall to reduce the wasted power.  	</li>  </ul></span>"

Leaky air conditioners||||| on the  	 other hand||||| can become a headache for these same households||||| often causing  	 moisture damage.</p>  <p>The moisture that drips out of an air conditioner generally comes from  	 the condensation that builds up on the air conditioner&rsquo;s evaporator coils.</p>  <p>Although this moisture is supposed to drip into a drain||||| it drips into  	 an overflow pan when this drain is clogged. If the overflow pan is clogged  	 or the moisture is dripping too fast||||| water can drip out of this pan as well.</p>  <p>Excess moisture dripping from an air conditioner is not only annoying|||||  	 but it can also have some disastrous effects if it isn&rsquo;t taken care  	 of promptly.

On an individual level||||| you probably devote a great portion of your summer  	 energy budget to air conditioning.</p>  <p>Fortunately||||| there are ways to keep the cooling load down||||| which cuts the  	 amount of heat that enters your home in the first place. Here are some  	 basic ways to keep your home cooler without spending more on air conditioning.</p>  <ul>  	<li>  		<strong>Block the sun:</strong> The sun&rsquo;s heat is the primary cause of heat gain in any enclosed  		 space. Therefore||||| if you can block the sun with shades||||| awnings||||| or strategically  		 planted trees||||| you have a way to shade your home against the relentless  		 summer sun.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Seal off the attic:</strong> Dark shingles and the enclosed space cause tremendous heat gain in the  		 attic. Make sure attic ventilation is up to par||||| that the attic floor  		 is sealed||||| and that adequate insulation covers every inch of the floor  		 to prevent air leaks from the attic.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Seal windows and doors:</strong> This measure is useful whether you&rsquo;re trying to reduce cooling loads  		 in the summer or heating loads in the winter. Leaky windows and doors  		 allow hot||||| humid outdoor air to get inside during the summer. Apply caulk  		 and weatherstripping around windows and door frames to help keep hot air out.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Seal ductwork:</strong> If you have central air conditioning||||| you could be losing energy in the  		 duct system. Leaky||||| un-insulated ducts are responsible for tremendous  		 energy waste.

Some things||||| like getting new HVAC  	 equipment||||| can require a real investment in order to see a return||||| while  	 other simple actions don&rsquo;t cost a cent.</p>  <p>  	That is the case for many Indiana homeowners when it comes to taking advantage  	 of the energy savings afforded by ceiling fans.  	<br>  	<br> When used in conjunction with your air conditioner||||| ceiling fans can lower  	 your electricity bills this summer while still keeping  </p>  <p>you cool and comfortable. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>  <ul>  	<li>You are probably familiar with wind chill||||| especially when it comes to  		 winter weather. Wind does not actually change the temperature of the air|||||  		 but it makes any particular temperature feel cooler than it actually is.</li>  	<li>Since ceiling fans create a wind indoors||||| they also create a wind chill.  		 The size of the wind chill effect is partly dependent on the real temperature;  		 the cooler the air||||| the bigger impact a breeze will make on how you feel.  		 So||||| whereas a ceiling fan in a hot house without air conditioning would  		 create very little wind chill effect||||| a fan that is blowing cooler air-conditioned  		 air will make the house feel about four degrees cooler than what is set  		 on the thermostat.</li>  	<li>Therefore||||| if you turn on a ceiling fan||||| you can turn the thermostat up  		 by four degrees but not feel any warmer. Raising your thermostat during  		 the summer significantly reduces how much electricity your air conditioner consumes.</li>  	<li>Since the wind chill effect is instantaneous||||| there is no need to turn  		 on a ceiling fan until you enter the room (and you can turn it off when  		 you leave the room). That means you only have to power one fan at a time|||||  		 and only do so when you are at home. Since a ceiling fan uses much less  		 electricity than an air conditioner regardless||||| your net energy savings  		 can really add up.</li>  </ul></span>"

Geothermal heat pumps tap into the stable underground temperatures  	 to condition your home&rsquo;s air||||| and can lower your energy bills by  	 as much as 60 percent. Recent advances in geothermal installations mean  	 that even homeowners with limited yard space can take advantage of these  	 heat pumps.</p>  <p>Although installing a geothermal heat pump costs more up front than an  	 air-source pump or other types of HVAC equipment||||| you recover the financial  	 investment over time as it operates to heat or cool your home. Besides  	 lower energy consumption||||| the systems last much longer and require less  	 maintenance than any other kind of heating and cooling equipment. The  	 underground loops can last as long as 50 years||||| while the life expectancy  	 of the above-ground parts||||| with routine maintenance||||| can perform 25 years  	 or more. Unlike air-source heat pumps||||| geothermal pumps do not use outdoor  	 condensers||||| which simplifies maintenance and reduces noise.</p>  <p>When considering a geothermal installation||||| it helps to work with an HVAC  	 contractor from the beginning. There&rsquo;s little about geothermal that  	 is in do-it-yourself territory||||| since the installation and specific type  	 of heat pump you choose depends on your yard||||| its geology and hydrology.  	 If you have a small yard||||| your options are likely to be limited to a vertical  	 system. That has a higher installation cost because deep trenches must  	 be dug by heavy equipment &mdash; always an expensive process.</p>  <p>As an incentive to put geothermal heat pumps in the realm of possibility  	 for more homeowners||||| the federal government offers a 30 percent tax credit  	 for people who install a geothermal system that meets specific guidelines  	 through 2016.

The minimum  	 SEER (seasonal energy efficiency ratio) stands at 13||||| and the HSPF (heating  	 season performance factor) must be 7.7. Features that raise both the SEER  	 and HSPF include:</p>  <ul>  	<li>  		<strong>Variable-speed motors: </strong>These are electronically commutated motors (ECMs) that use less electricity  		 than standard blower motors. While these motors raise the SEER in both  		 the blower and outdoor compressor||||| in our region||||| the benefits of having  		 an ECM in the blower also increase indoor comfort. The motors run more  		 quietly than standard blower motors||||| and for longer periods. In the summer|||||  		 the longer operational time removes more humidity. The motors start and  		 stop slowly; in the winter||||| this stops the cold blast of air coming from  		 the registers.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Dual-speed compressors:</strong> These save electricity by compressing the refrigerant at different speeds|||||  		 only operating at high speed when the weather is the hottest. Not only  		 does this save a lot of electricity in the summer||||| it also lowers the  		 wear and tear on the compressor.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Scroll compressors:</strong> Because heating demands are high here||||| a heat pump with a scroll compressor  		 delivers 10 to 15 degrees more warmth indoors than a standard compressor.  		 These compressors also have a longer life than a piston compressor.  	</li>  	<li>  		<strong>Dual-fuel heat pumps:</strong> These systems utilize the energy efficiency of a pump until temperatures  		 drop into the 30s||||| at which time they switch to a burner that uses combustible  		 fuel. Instead of having to burn fuel all winter||||| you can harvest what  		 heat is in the air during the fall and spring||||| relying on fuel only when  		 the weather is coldest. The AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency)  		 ratings of the burners||||| along with the HSPF of the heat pumps||||| drive the  		 efficiency of the dual-fuel systems.  		<strong></strong>  	</li>  </ul></span>"
